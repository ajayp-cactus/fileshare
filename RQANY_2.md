## Abstract  East Asian marginal sea surrounding China exhibit rich ocean upwelling, mostly in response to

the southwesterly summer monsoon. Upwelling in the China seas, namely, the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea, has become increasingly important because the potential changes in the upwelling may have dramatic ecosystem, socioeconomic, and climate impacts. This paper reviews the progress of upwelling studies in the China seas since the year 2000, by presenting the principal characteristics and new understanding of 12 major upwelling regions in the China seas. Upwelling exhibits long-term variability at intraseasonal to multidecadal scales as well as short-term variability frequently caused by tropical cyclones. It is also associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, local environmental variation, and biogeochemical factors. The coastal upwelling around Hainan Island and the upwelling or cold dome northeast of Taiwan Island are specifically highlighted because they have attracted great interest for decades. This paper summarizes upwelling mechanisms in terms of wind, topography, tide, stratification, and background flow, with applications mostly to the China seas. Finally, we propose some topics for future upwelling research, i.e., potential intensification of coastal upwelling under global climate change, downwelling, intrusion of upwelling into coastal embayments, and the influence of upwelling on fishery and biogeochemical processes.

## 1. Introduction

Upwelling in the ocean is defined as an upward movement of seawater, with a speed ranging from about 10 - 6 to 10 - 4 m/s. As upwelled water carries a large amount of nutrients (such as phosphate and nitrate) from the lower layer to the upper layer or even to the surface layer of the ocean, upwelling regions generally are important fishing areas. Upwelling, with relatively high chlorophyll (Chl a ) concentration and relatively low sea surface temperature (SST), is as commonly observed in the China seas [ Wei et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2012], is also of major importance to primary and secondary productivity and strongly influences atmosphere-ocean CO$\_{2}$ exchange and carbon recycling [ McGregor et al., 2007]. Figure 1 illustrates monthly mean SST in August 2013 and presents several upwelling-related low SST regions in the China seas.

The China seas (Figure 2), namely, the South China Sea (SCS), the Taiwan Strait (TWS), the East China Sea (ECS, or the Donghai Sea), the Yellow Sea (or the Huanghai Sea), and the Bohai Sea, are located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Upwelling in the China seas is usually induced by winds and is largely affected by local circulation, topography, and tides.

Being in the subtropical monsoon regime, the China seas are characterized by distinctly seasonal variation of winds. In winter, these seas are predominantly controlled by northeasterly and northerly winds. In summer, the SCS is dominated by southwesterly and southwesterly winds, while the ECS, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea are governed by southerly and southeasterly winds (Figure 1) [e.g., Zheng, 2011; X. Y. Chen et al., 2014].

The circulation in the China seas includes the Kuroshio Warm Current system, the China Coastal Current system, and some local currents or gyres, as shown in Figure 3 [e.g., Zheng et al., 2006]. The circulation in the ECS, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea usually flows in an anticyclonic pattern [e.g., Isobe, 2008]. Specifically, the Kuroshio flows northeastward in the eastern ECS and the subsurface water of the Kuroshio northeast of Taiwan may intrude to the coast of Zhejiang and contribute to the formation of upwelling there in summer (Figure 4) [Yang et al., 2011, 2013]. The coastal current does not mainly depend on the wind field in the Yellow Sea but differs from season to season in the ECS.

There are three currents in the TWS: the China Coastal Current along the western TWS, the extension of the SCS Warm Current in the western and central TWS, and the Kuroshio's branch or loop current intruding through the eastern TWS [Hu et al., 2010]. The latter two currents play significant roles in the upwelling in

2015]. In the Sabah waters of the southeastern SCS, phytoplankton blooms frequently appear from December to the following April as a result of strong northeasterly wind-induced coastal upwelling [Abdul-Hadi et al., 2013].

Upwelling in the ECS, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea can also be verified by the distribution of marine chemical and biological elements [Chen et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004]. Observations in the 2000s showed that the spring upwelling increases the phosphate, nitrate, and silicate concentrations in the mixed layer, followed by an increase in Chl a concentration, but the summer upwelling is relatively weaker and is strongly influenced by turbid Yangtze River plume water [Pei et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2011]. The Yangtze River plume water and coastal upwelling can significantly influence the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities of phytoplankton phosphorus deficiency in the Yangtze River plume [Tseng et al., 2014].

Coupled physical and biological models have been applied to study upwelling and its associated biogeochemical responses in the Bohai Sea [Zhang et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007]. Another coupled physical- biological numerical ocean model estimated the physical (i.e., coastal upwelling) and biological effects on nutrient transport in the TWS during summer [J. Wang et al., 2013]. These results indicated that high phytoplankton biomass appears in the upwelling region.

Many studies have focused on the responses of phytoplankton to typhoon-induced upwelling [e.g., Zheng and Tang, 2007; Chang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2013]. If the typhoon has a longer forcing time, it may induce a stronger phytoplankton bloom. Ch.l a concentration ( &gt; 3 mg/m³) in the SCS is 30 times larger after typhoon passage in comparison with the respective monthly mean level of Chl a concentration [Chen et al., 2012]. This kind of typhoon-induced bloom often appears along or to the right of the typhoon track a few days after the passage of the typhoon and lasts for 1-2 weeks at the surface layer or even more than 3 weeks in the subsurface layer [Ye et al., 2013]. Moreover, the ocean-atmosphere interactions and fisheries data collected before and after the passage of several typhoons across the southern region of the ECS suggested that typhoons can enhance upwelling that results not only in increases of Chl a but also in changes of local fish communities and, consequently, fishing activities [Chang et al., 2014]. Typhoon-induced upwelling can indeed stimulate efficient particulate organic carbon export out of the euphotic zone [Shih et al., 2013]. In the waters near the typhoon's path, especially in the typhoon-induced upwelling area, nutrient-rich bottom water stirred by the typhoon can promote an outbreak of aquatic organisms and significantly increase the probability of red tide occurrence [Li et al., 2015].

## 2.3. Summary

There are 12 major upwelling regions in the China seas, as shown in Figure 2. Some principal features of these upwelling regions are summarized below.

- 1. The summertime upwelling regions in the northern SCS are mostly along the eastern coast of Hainan Island and along the coasts of eastern Guangdong and southern Fujian.
- 2. Coastal upwelling in the western SCS usually appears along the Vietnam coast in summer, with the strongest intensity in August being accompanied by a cold jet extending eastward from the coastal waters. The Vietnam cold eddy is located east of the central Vietnam coast.
- 3. The Luzon cold eddy is a large eddy off western Luzon Island in winter.
- 4. Four upwelling regions in the TWS are located along the southwestern and northwestern coasts of the TWS, around the Taiwan Bank, and around the Penghu Islands.
- 5. Coastal upwelling exists in the Yangtze River Estuary and along the Zhejiang coast in the ECS. In addition, an upwelling or a cold dome also appears in the outer shelf break area of the ECS, i.e., in the sea area off northeastern Taiwan Island.
- 6. Additionally, four other upwelling regions in the China seas (Figure 2) have been reported to sometimes appear in the northern Bohai Strait [Wei et al., 2003], off the southwest coast of Hainan Island [Li et al., 2008], along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia [Daryabor et al., 2014], and near the Sabah coast of the southeastern SCS [Abdul-Hadi et al., 2013], respectively.

## 3. Upwelling Dynamics With Applications to the China Seas

Although many numerical models have been applied to study the upwelling dynamics, there still exist diverging views for interpreting each upwelling region in the China seas. Upwelling is an oceanographic

Another mechanism inducing upwelling near a coastal promotor or a cape, just like the one over the ECS shelf, is the strengthened geostrophic shoreward transport downstream of a promontory due to the forma- tion of a countercurrent (negative) pressure gradient force around the promontory as the upwelling jet veers shoreward [Liu and Gan, 2014]. However, the pressure gradient force that drives the upwelling over a submerged valley in the ECS is the combined result of the nonlinearity due to vertical squeezing of vortex tube and bottom frictional effects [Liu and Gan, 2015].

## 3.5. Tidal Mixing or Internal Tide

Tide, through a tidal mixing effect or internal tide, plays a key role in modulating or intensifying the upwelling, such as around the Taiwan Bank or southwest of Hainan Island (Table 1). For the upwelling around the Taiwan Bank, upward transport of the SCS water carries cold water from the subsurface layer to a depth of approximately 25 m near the Taiwan Bank, then strong tidal mixing forces this upwelled water further upward to the surface or near the surface layer [Hong et al., 2011a; Jiang et al., 2011]. For the summertime upwelling off the southwestern coast of Hainan Island, the existing tidal mixing front [Hu et al., 2003a] has

(Table 1). When a cyclonic current flows around a cape, the relative vorticity change along a streamline is favorable and dominant for producing an upwelling downstream and adjacent to the cape, whereas the frictional diffusion of vorticity has a lower or even opposite effect. The relative vorticity change overwhems the frictional diffusion of vorticity for determining vertical velocity at 20-27 km offshore [Z. Y. Chen et al., 2014]. As for a coastal canyon, upwelling is produced over the canyon axis and in the downstream area of the canyon by the relative vorticity change, while the frictional diffusion of vorticity

Cited from Figure 2 of Lentz and Chapman [2004].

tion by thinning and strengthening both the seaward transport in the plume and the shoreward transport beneath it [ Gan et al. , 2009b]. Stratification has a profound influence on the wind-driven upwelling or downwelling over a shallow shelf. When the water column is stratified, the wind-driven near-surface cross-shelf transport has similar magnitude but opposite direction as the near-bottom cross-shelf transport over the mid and outer shelf. Under the stratified condition, upwelling or downwelling is usually confined near the coast where stratification may be maintained by a balance between vertical mixing and buoyancy forcing [ Lentz, 2001]. Given a two-dimensional, wind-driven, and stratified flow over a sloping bottom (Figure 12), the geostrophic along-shelf flow is in the direction of the wind stress and decreases linearly with depth. Therefore, an upwelling is generated by the wind-driven offshore transport in the surface boundary layer, which is balanced by the friction-driven onshore transport in the bottom boundary layer over the shelf [ Lentz and Chapman, 2004].

For a stratified fluid, the Joint Effect of Baroclinicity and Relief (JEBAR) term in the momentum equations also plays an important role in upwelling or downwelling phenomena. Such situations are usually typical for the upwelling or downwelling off the Pearl River Estuary in the northern SCS [ Gan et al. , 2013] (Table 1).

## 3.7. Background Flow

Background flow, such as the Kuroshio, local circulation, eddy, or near-bottom current, is another factor affecting or modulating the upwelling. This influencing factor has been recognized frequently in the China seas (Table 1). For example, as long as there exists an alongshore eastward current, no matter the case of upwelling/upwelling relaxation or downwelling relaxation/downwelling, it activates the interaction of the flow with the widened shelf topography to form shoreward geostrophic and bottom Ekman transports, from which a cross-isobath shoreward upslope motion is formed [ Gan et al. , 2015]. In the ECS, the Taiwan Warm Current itself is a producer for the coastal upwelling through its encroachment and ascending onto the topography slope, especially in summer [ Lu et al. , 2006], but the Taiwan Warm Current may weaken the upwelling in winter [ Qiao et al. , 2006].

Additionally, the mesoscale warm eddies produced by the Kuroshio intrusion into the ECS have remarkable effects on modulating upwelling [ Xiu et al. , 2002]. It is therefore significant to pursue further understanding of how these eddies or currents (i.e., the Kuroshio) interact with upwelling, especially in the SCS and the ECS, where mesoscale eddies are mostly active [ e.g., Li et al. , 2003].

## 4. Some Considerations on Further Upwelling-Related Studies

This paper reviewed the studies of upwelling in the China seas, namely, the SCS, the TWS, the ECS, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea, conducted since 2000. The upwelling in the coastal waters of China is complex. It is

Meanwhile, internal tides can affect the upwelling, especially in the southern Taiwan Bank, off the coast of eastern Guangdong, and in the northern SCS, where internal tides can enhance the uplifting of lower layer water and thus intensify the upwelling [ Gu et al. , 2012; Pan et al. , 2012a]. Therefore, the summertime upwelling pattern and intensity tend to be altered on the shelf off Guangdong as a result of the interaction between the upwelling and internal tides.

## 3.6. Stratification

Stratified fluid occurs regularly in the China seas in summer or in the coastal area when it is affected by the river plume. The buoyancy in the plume alters the wind-driven upwelling circula-

characterized not only by long-term variation associated with ENSO events and global climate change but also by short-term variation related to winds, internal tides, and tropical cyclones. Therefore, it is difficult to rely on observations by limited cruises or at several stations to reveal the dynamic and biogeochemical processes in these upwelling regions. It has been suggested that long-term monitoring be implemented to investigate the upwelling and its surrounding dynamic environments using satellite technology and seabed-based and shore-based observations [ Hu et al. , 2003b ]. During 2005-2011, offshore surveys were conducted in all four seasons to obtain comprehensive observational data in the Chinese coastal waters. These data, combined with multisource satellite data and marine eco-dynamic models, have resulted in a deepened understanding of the upwelling and its dynamic environments in the coastal waters of China [ Qiao. 2012 ; Xiong et al. , 2012 ].

The following aspects should be addressed in future upwelling studies in the China seas.

- 1. Potential intensification of coastal upwelling under global climate change. An intensification of coastal upwellings in response to global climate change has been proposed through the last few decades [ e.g. , Bakun, 1990 ; McGregor et al. , 2007 ]. A similar trend also exists in the China seas. For instance, the winddriven coastal upwelling off eastern Hainan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang has shown a trend of intensification based on 40 year coastal upwelling index [ Bakun, 1973 ] data [ Miao and Hu, 2011 ]. A state-space decomposition of the alongshore wind stress time series exhibited an intensification of upwelling in the SCS during the "upwelling season" for the period of 1988-2008 [ Su et al. , 2013 ]. Climate change effects on regional monsoon are complex and uncertain. Specifically, changes in the large-scale Asian summer monsoon [ Christensen et al. , 2013 ] will certainly affect coastal winds and upwelling. Clearly, more research should be conducted to reveal the response of coastal upwelling to global climate change, for the upwelling in the China seas and also for global upwelling regions.
- 2. Downwelling study. Compared with upwelling, it is more difficult to describe downwelling by means of temperature and salinity distributions. Recent observational, theoretical, and modeling studies have suggested that downwelling results from surface buoyancy loss in boundary currents or is concentrated in strong currents subject to buoyancy loss near lateral boundaries [ e.g. , Spall, 2008 ; Cenedese, 2012 ]. For the China seas, the dynamics of intensified downwelling over a widened shelf in the northeastern SCS have been studied [ Gan et al. , 2013 ], and this study may be regarded as a pioneer work for stimulating more downwelling studies in the China seas. Since the trend of global warming became prominent, a number of papers have focused on carbon sequestration, deep-sea cycling mechanisms, and especially on the downwelling that transports carbon downward to the deep ocean. Therefore, the study of downwelling should be pushed forward.
- 3. Intrusion of upwelling into a coastal embayment. Upwelling-related cold water has been reported to intrude Sanya Bay (located south of Hainan Island) [ Dong et al. , 2002 ]. Coastal upwelling of oxygen-depleted bottom water was observed intruding Tokyo Bay, which caused mortality of shellfish and other aquatic animals around the bay [ Zhu and Yu, 2014 ]. The behavior of the bottom water intruded into a bay varies with wind direction and strength. Because there are many small embayments along the coastlines of the China seas, a systematic study of upwelling intrusion into the bay's estuaries of the China seas will be of significance, both scientifically and ecologically, to these coastal environments.
- 4. Influence of upwelling on fishery and biogeochemical processes. This paper reviewed the upwelling in the China seas, mostly in term of its hydrographic features. However, upwelling has a great impact on biogeochemical and even fisheries-related processes, which are the well-known elements usually associated with upwelling systems. For example, upwelling can exert significant influences on biological activities in the euphotic zone, where light can penetrate, and can also impact particulate organic carbon export flux depending on upwelling conditions [ Jiao et al. , 2014 ]. This topic deserves a follow-up review in the near future in cooperation with other scientists in the fields of biogeochemistry and fisheries.

the characteristics and mechanisms of upwelling and its variability in the China seas has significantly progressed since 2000.

This review paper documents the progress of upwelling studies in the China seas during 2000-2015 (sections 2.1 and 2.2) and presents a summary of the upwelling studies in the China seas (section 2.3). In section 3, the dynamics of the upwelling studies are specifically summarized and discussed. Finally, in section 4, we propose some considerations about further studies on upwelling that are of global significance and of great interest to the broad community.

## 2. Progress of Upwelling Studies in the China Seas

## 2.1. Characteristics of Major Upwelling Regions in the China Seas

## 2.1.1. Upwelling in the South China Sea

Wu and Li [2003] summarized the upwelling research in the SCS during the 40 years of 1964-2003 and emphasized the temporal and spatial distributions of upwelling in the northern SCS. Their review concluded that the upwelling covers almost the entire northern continental shelf of the SCS in summer. Since 2000, several cruises acquiring hydrographical or comprehensive observations have been conducted in the northern SCS. These cruise data further indicated that the coastal upwelling appears earlier and is stronger along the eastern Guangdong coast than along the southern Fuji coast (e.g., Xu et al ., 2013, 2014). Moreover, satellite remote sensing SST and Chl a data from different sources demonstrated that the upwelled water in the surface layer of the Guangdong coast can appear in a jet-like wedge shape [Gu et al ., 2015].

Through the recent decade, much attention was paid to the coastal upwelling along the coast of Vietnam (Vietnam coastal upwelling) [e.g., Barthel et al ., 2009; Dippner and Loick-Wile, 2011] and the cold eddy off central Vietnam (Vietnam cold eddy) [e.g., He et al ., 2002; Guo et al ., 2006]. Climatological temperature and

the TWS [Hu et al ., 2003b]. However, these currents exhibit differences between winter and summer seasons and between upper and lower layers.

The upper layer circulation of the SCS is cyclonic in winter but anticyclonic in summer [Hu et al ., 2000; Gan et al ., 2006]. In winter, two cyclonic eddies exist west of Luzon Island (Luzon cold eddy) and in the southwestern SCS, respectively. In summer, a coastal jet forms between an anticyclonic eddy in the southwestern SCS and another cyclonic eddy (Vietnam cold eddy) off the central coast of Vietnam [e.g., Gan and Qu, 2008]. In addition, the northern SCS circulation pattern is modified by including the SCS Warm Current, the seasonal Kuroshio intrusion, and some mesoscale eddies, which accordingly modulate the upwelling in the northern SCS.

Previous studies on the upwelling in the SCS and the TWS have been summarized mainly in two review papers by Wu and Li [2003] and Hu et al . [2003b], respectively. These authors collected several decades of research results on upwelling, mostly before 2000. However, our understanding of

as a cold eddy, named the Luzon cold eddy. This cyclonic eddy has been identified off northwestern Luzon Island by altimeter data [e.g., Ho et al., 2000b; Hwang and Chen, 2000], by historical temperature and salinity data [e.g., Qu, 2000; Udarb-Walker and Villanoy, 2001], and by a total of 105 years of observational data in the SCS [Liu et al., 2006]. The eddy exists for 7 months from October to the following May, developing in October- November, intensifying in December-January, and decaying in February-May. It covers an area from 16° to 19°N and from 117° to 120°E (Figure 5) and reaches maximum size during its intensification period. Additional evidence has shown that this cyclonic eddy sometimes has two or three cold cores off western Luzon Island [Yuan et al., 2004; Sun and Liu, 2011].

Many hydrological measurements [e.g., Wan et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013] and satellite observations acquired during the last 15 years [e.g., Tang et al., 2002; Shang et al., 2004] and numerical models developed during this period [e.g., Pan and Sha, 2004] have further confirmed that two regions of coastal upwelling in the southwestern and northwestern TWS usually appear during the summertime southwesterly monsoon period and that another two regions of upwelling around the Taiwan Bank and the Penghu Islands exist all year round. For example, observations showed that evident coastal upwelling appeared in the southwestern

## 2.1.3. Upwelling in the East China Sea

Coastal upwelling phenomena in the ECS have been observed along the Zhejiang coast and in the Yangtze River (or Changjiang River) Estuary. In the Yangtze River Estuary, there exists upwelling with a scale of about 1° in longitude and 1° in latitude centered around (31°30'N, 122°40'E) [Zhao et al. , 2001]. Signals of lowtemperature and high-salinity upwelling water in the Yangtze River Estuary appeared at three sections of the temperature and salinity distributions (Figure 6) obtained from a cruise in August 2000 [Zhu, 2003; Zhu et al. , 2003; Liu et al. , 2006]. Evidently, the high-salinity water can upwell toward 5-10 m layer from the lower layer and affect the salinity distribution in the Yangtze River Estuary. Along the Zhejiang coast, upwelling

Vertical distributions of (a, c, and e) temperature (°C) and (b, d, and f) salinity along Section 32.0°N (Figures 6a and 6b), Section 31.5°N (Figures 6c and 6d), and Section 31.0°N (Figures 6e and 6f) in the Yangtze River Estuary. The interpolated contours are shown as dashed lines. Cited from Figure 3 of Li et al. [2006].

alongshore component of wind stress. Such variability of coastal upwelling can also be demonstrated by a variable hydrographical structure in the sea area near Dongshan with different scale, location, and intensity of low-temperature and high-salinity water [ Hu et al. , 2011a]. In addition to interannual variability, two regions of coastal upwelling in the western TWS have clear intermonthly variability in summer [ Hu et al. , 2001], and the coastal upwelling and cold eddy off Vietnam are punctuated by the intraseasonal oscillation [ e.g., Xie et al. , 2007].

Long-term variability of upwelling is usually associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). As the sea surface wind was much weaker in the TWS during the 1997 El Niño year than during the 1998 La Niña year [Kuo and Ho, 2004], the coastal upwelling in the TWS was correspondingly weak and strong in summers of 1997 and 1998, respectively [e.g., Hong et al. , 2011b]. The coastal upwelling in the northern SCS was also significantly strengthened during the summer of 1998 (a La Niña year) when the alongshore wind stress was dramatically enhanced over the region [ Jing et al. , 2011]. However, a recent research also proposed that the summer SST in the SCS is correlated with ENSO in the preceding winter [ Yang et al. , 2015]. The coastal

upwelling in the western SCS is strong with the center moving southward in an El Ni˜ no year (such as 1997 and 2003) but weak in a La Ni˜ na year (such as 1998) [e.g., Kuo et al., 2004; Hein et al., 2013]. The Luzon cold eddy has significant interannual variation and is highly correlated to the ENSO events, as demonstrated by an extra-strong basin-wide warming in the summer of 1998 that persisted until autumn and winter and pre- vented the formation of winter upwelling off Luzon in that year [Wu and Chang, 2005].

The prominent multidecadal variability of upwelling in the northern SCS has been driven by Asian summer monsoon dynamics, with an abrupt transition from a warmer to a colder condition in 1930 and a return to a warmer condition after 1960 [Liu et al., 2013]. In addition, an oscillation of coastal upwelling with significant fluctuations on interannual and decadal scales has been revealed off eastern Hainan Island [e.g., Liu et al., 2009; Su et al., 2013].

## 2.2.2. Upwelling Variability: Upwelling or Cold Eddy Induced by Tropical Cyclones

Short-term variability of upwelling can be caused by the tropical cyclones (including typhoons) frequently passing over the SCS and the ECS each year. Responses of the upper ocean to tropical cyclone have been studied extensively for the past 15 years [Chen et al., 2013]. One pioneer work in the SCS demonstrated the oceanic response to tropical cyclone in Ernie 1996, indicating an intense upwelling at the subsurface layer and an evident surface cooling to the right of the storm track [Chu et al., 2000]. Since 2000, much additional related research has been conducted using in situ data, remote sensing data, and numerical models. For example, several numerical results showed that (1) the typhoon-induced upwelling is responsible for 84% of the cooling in the lower surface layer (40-70 m) [Wang and Qiao, 2008] and (2) the SST can drop by 2-6°C in a rightward-biased response to typhoon [Cui et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2009].

A cold eddy is generally induced when a typhoon moves in a loop form over the SCS [Hu and Kawamura, 2004]. An increasing number of cases have further revealed the oceanic responses to various tropical cyclones in the SCS [e.g., Shang et al., 2008; Su et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2012]. For instance, one showed that a classic cooling anomaly usually occurs to the right of the storm track during the typhoon forced period and that cold anomaly water also exists toward the left of the storm track in the typhoon relaxation period around the Luzon Strait [Kuo et al., 2011]. One other case indicated that the coastal upwelling along the eastern Guangdong coast is sensitive to subtle changes in typhoon intensity and path [Pan et al., 2012b]. Yet another showed that ocean mixed layer deepening, which is regarded as an important parameter characterizing upwelling and turbulent mixing driven by strong typhoon wind, can be seen after typhoon passage over the SCS [Pan and Sun, 2013]. In addition, the thermocline depth is a major factor for the tropical cyclone-induced SST cooling. In particular, the cooling in the SCS is more than 1.5 times that in the tropical northwestern Pacific Ocean because of a shallower mixed layer and stronger subsurface thermal stratification in the SCS [Mei et al., 2015].

In the ECS, typhoon-induced oceanic cooling or upwelling is complicated by the presence of the continental shelf of the ECS and the Kuroshio [Chen et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2008]. The upwelling caused by a typhoon east of Taiwan can induce an east-west sea level difference that enhances the Kuroshio in the area [Morimoto et al., 2009].

Typhoon Kai-Tak, which traversed the northeastern SCS in July 2000, was a typical typhoon that has attracted much interest. Cold patches, with anomalous cooling of up to 6°C below the surrounding warm tropical ocean, formed in the SCS in the trail of the typhoon [Lin et al., 2003b]. Additional evidence showed that Typhoon Kai-Tak triggered an average thirtyfold increase in surface Chl a concentration, which contributed to 2-4% of the SCS's annual new production [Lin et al., 2003a]. A basin-scale ocean model was used to simulate the oceanic response to Typhoon Kai-Tak, and it obtained a drop in SST of more than 9°C, which was attributed to the influence of the slow-moving typhoon, initial stratification, and bathymetry-induced upwelling [Tseng et al., 2010]. The upwelling and entrainment induced by Typhoon Kai-Tak accounted for 62% and 31% of the SST drop, respectively, the upwelling contribution was twice the vertical entrainment contribution [Chiang et al., 2011]. Clearly, Typhoon Kai-Tak produced a record SST drop of about 10.8°C (Figure 7) and a high Chl a concentration because it passed over a cold eddy with an amosly welled thermocline at the "right time."

## 2.2.3. Upwelling East and Northeast of Hainan Island

The upwelling off the eastern coast of Hainan Island is strong in summer, which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years [Xie et al., 2012]. It has been revealed that the coastal upwelling begins in April, becomes

strongest in summer (peaking from mid-July to mid-August), and remains evident until September, that the upwelling-favorable wind is the main driving force, and that the alongshore topographic variation plays an important role in generating upwelling centers distributed along the eastern Hainan coast [e.g., Su and Pohlmann, 2009; Li et al., 2012; Jing et al., 2015]. Moreover, the wind stress curl-induced Ekman pumping is considered to be another crucial effect generating the coastal upwelling off eastern Hainan Island and eastern Leizhou Peninsula [Jing et al., 2009]. Recently, the upwelling has been classified into three patterns, i.e., intensified upwelling off the eastern coast of Hainan Island (HEU), intensified upwelling off the northeastern coast of Hainan Island (HNEU), and both HEU and HNEU in 1 day [Lin et al., 2016a]. Reanalysis data and satellite data have shown that the HEU is mainly driven by southwesterly wind and is not affected remarkably by fresh water, whereas the HNEU is associated with the prevailing southeasterly wind and can be limited in the lower layer when it is covered by fresh water. Numerical experiments have further indicated that the HNEU is principally intensified by an along-isobath barotropic pressure gradient force, but baroclinic processes make negative contributions to the formation of the HNEU [Lin et al., 2016b].

## 2.2.4. Upwelling or Cold Dome Northeast of Taiwan Island

The cold eddy or upwelling off the northeastern part of Taiwan Island has been studied for several decades because the cyclonic eddy is regarded as an important conduit for the exchange of material between the ECS shelf and the adjoining Kuroshio [Wong et al., 2000].

The 200 m (thin white line), 500 m (thick white line), and 1000 m (dashed white line) isobaths are plotted in each panel. The white cross in Figure 8a marks the center of the cold dome.

Observational data have revealed the seasonal variation, three-dimensional structure, and spatial-temporal distribution of the cold eddy northeast of Taiwan [e.g., Xiu et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009]. The cold eddy exists northeast of Taiwan all year round, with two or three cold cores in summer and autumn, and has large seasonal variations. The cold eddy is characterized by low temperature, high salinity, high density, low dissolved oxygen, high phosphate, high silicate, and high nitrate [Tseng et al., 2012]. These features are related to the dynamic balance between the Kuroshio meandering and the TWS water intruding into the ECS continental shelf. In particular, this cold eddy was also found to have atmospheric effects in spring and winter due to the intrusions of warm Kuroshio water onto the continental shelf of the ECS [Chow et al., 2015].

Numerical modeling has also indicated that an upwelling is located in the shelf break off northeast Taiwan. Some model results have suggested that strong upwelling exists when the Kuroshio surface water intrudes from the sea area northeast of Taiwan to the continental shelf and that the largest upwelling speed is on the order of 5 × 10 - 6 m/s [e.g., Lee and Chao, 2003; Xiu and Huang, 2006; Wu et al., 2008]. Another model proposed that vorticity effects are prominent in the upwelling in the nonsummer months [Chang et al., 2010].

The cold eddy northeast of Taiwan has also been recognized as a cold dome that results in the formation of upwelling in the northeastern Taiwan shelf [e.g., Jan et al., 2011] and has been confirmed by some highresolution numerical models [e.g., Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013]. The cold dome has a diameter of approximately 100 km, is centered around (25.625$^{N}$, 122.125$^{E}$) when taking the temperature at 50 m depth as the reference (Figure 8), and is maintained by cold and saline water upwelling along the continental slope. Monsoon-driven intrusion of the Kuroshio onto the ECS shelf intensifies the upwelling and brings more subsurface water up to the cold dome during winter than during summer monsoon season. However, it is suggested that the surface cold dome occurs more frequently in summer, when it includes an unusual contribution from the cold water residual associated with typhoon events [Shen et al., 2011].

## 2.2.5. Biogeochemical Responses to Upwelling

As upwelling is a key driver of biogeochemical processes and ecosystem dynamics, the biogeochemical responses to upwelling in the China seas have been considered to be of importance for decades. For example, multiple satellite data have shown that the Vietnam coastal upwelling coincides with the regional increase of phytoplankton biomass in terms of shape, timing, and location [e.g., Tang et al., 2004b].

The northeasterly monsoon wind-induced upwelling has important effects on the biogeochemical cycles in the Luzon cold eddy region [e.g., Chen et al., 2006]. Specifically, in the region northwest of Luzon Island, the winter phytoplankton bloom is primarily induced by Ekman pumping-driven upwelling (observed at about 50 m below the sea surface) and upper mixed layer entrainment [e.g., J. J. Wang et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012]. In the Luzon Strait, the winter bloom occurs during the relaxation period of intensified northeasterly winds when the deepened mixed layer starts to shoal, and the advection of relative vorticity primarily contributes to the subsurface upwelling that supplies nutrients to the region below the mixed layer [ Lu et al.,
