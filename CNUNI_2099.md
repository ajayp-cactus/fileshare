Eunkyoo Oh, 1,3 Pil Joon Seo, 2,3 Jungmook Kim, 1,*

Small peptides mediate cell-cell communication to coordinate a variety of plant developmental processes. Signaling peptides specifically bind to the extracellular domains of receptors that belong to the receptor-like kinase family, and the peptide-receptor interaction activates a range of biochemical and physiological processes. The plant root is crucial for the anchorage of plants in soil as well as for the uptake of water and nutrients. Over recent years great progress has been made in the identification of receptors, structural analysis of peptide- receptor pairs, and characterization of their signaling pathways during plant root development. We review here recent advances in the elucidation of the functions and molecular mechanisms of signaling peptides, the peptide-receptor pairs that activate signal initiation, and their signaling pathways during root development.

## Brief Introduction to Signaling Peptides

Small peptides are emerging as key signaling molecules that coordinate various aspects of developmental processes in plants. Systemin, that induces an immune response in young tomato plants, was the first identified peptide hormone in plants [1], and since then many other signaling peptides have been identified that play roles in a myriad of plant developmental processes [2-4]. Signaling peptides are categorized into secreted peptides and non-sected peptides. Secreted signaling peptides can be further divided into two major classes: posttranslationally modified peptides and cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) [3]. Post-translationally modified signaling peptides are usually synthesized as larger inactive precursors harboring an N-terminal secretion sequence, a central variable region, and a C-terminal functional domain [3]. The precursor proteins undergo post-translational modifications such as tyrosine sulfation, proline hydroxylation, hydroxyproline arabinosylation, and proteolytic processing to produce functional small mature peptides of 5 to 20 amino acids (aa) in length [3] (Figure 1). However, the order of the modifications and of processing and proteolysis is not clear in plants. By contrast, CRP peptides are characterized by the presence of 2-16 cysteine residues (typically 6 or 8) and intramolecular disulfide bonds, with or without proteolytic processing, and comprise 40 to &gt;100 aa [3] (Figure 1).

Additional repertoires of peptide biosynthesis underlie the huge diversity of plant peptides. Some peptides are derived from functional proteins, and the biochemical activities of derived peptides may differ from those of the original functional precursors. In addition, small open reading frames (sORFs) embedded in transcripts are additional sources of functional peptides. The sORFs are usually located in the 5' leader sequence of the main ORFs in the primary transcript of miRNAs, as well as in other transcripts, and potentially encode peptides of 30-100 aa. They are directly translated without intermediate precursors and proteolytic processing, adding to the complexity of plant peptides [5]. More than 1000 signaling peptides

Highlights Small peptides are emerging as key signaling molecules in coordinating various aspects of plant root development.

Small signaling peptides are usually recognized by the extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins belonging to the receptor-like kinase family, and SERK family receptor-like kinases function as coreceptors for the peptide-receptor-like kinase kinase pair activation via peptide-induced heterodimerization and transphosphorylation. Small signaling peptides and their receptors modulate plant root development in response to changing levels of nitrogen in the soil as well as to adverse environmental conditions.

Small peptides can act as both long- distance signals and as local signals for root responses, acting via receptors located in different plant tissues.

kinase (RIPK), to trigger activation of the GEF-ROP pathway that mediates auxin-dependent root hair development [7,77].

The Roles of GLV/RGF/CLEL Peptides in Root Hair Elongation Some members of GLV/RGF/CLEL family, which is closely related to the CLE family, participate in root hair formation [52]. GLV4 and GLV8 are expressed in root cortical and non-hair cells. Ectopic expression of GLV4 and GLV8 produces abnormal root hairs with irregular shapes, whereas loss-of-function mutants display shorter root hairs without cell-fate changes [52]. Thus these peptides act to assist proper root hair elongation in a non-cell-autonomous manner (Figure 2A).

## Signaling Peptides in Root Modulation

The Roles of CLE Homologs and Their Receptors in Regulating Root Modulation Homologs of CLE peptides and CLV receptors [CLV1, Receptor-like protein kinase 2 (RPK2), and CLV2-CRN] regulate module numbers in legumes. The involvement of CLE signaling in the autoregulation of nodulation (AON) was first identified in soybean Glycine max (Box 3). Over- expression of soybean rhizobia-INCLUDED CLE1, 2, and Nritate-Induced CLE (GmR1C1, GmR1C2, and GmN1C) inhibits nodulation, whereas mutations in the soybean CLV1-homolog NODULE AUTOREGULATION RECEPTOR KINASE (GmNRK) result in hypernodulation [78]. Nodulation in nark mutants is not inhibited by GmCLE, indicating that the GmCLE-GmNRK pair regulates AON [78,79] (Figure 2B).

The CLE-dependent regulation of AON is observed in other legumes such as Lotus japonicus and M. truncata . The L. japonicus genome contains at least 39 LjCLE genes [80]. Of these, the CLE peptides, LjCLE-Root Signal 1 (LjCLE-RS1) and LjCLE-RS2, are upregulated upon rhizobial infection through a NODULE INCEPTION (NIN)-dependent pathway [80,81]. Transformation of L. japonicus hairy roots with LjCLE-RS1 and LjCLE-RS2 locally and systemically reduces the number of nodules [80]. Application of a synthetic arabinosylated CLE-RS2 peptide suppresses nodulation [82], LjCLE-RS1 and LjCLE-RS2, derived from the root, are transported through the xylem and are perceived in the shoot by the CLV1-homolog HYPER- NODULATION ABERRANT ROOT FORMATION 1 (HAR1) LRR-RLK [80,82] (Figure 2B). KLAV- IER (KLV), a homolog of arabidopsis RPK2, interacts with HAR1, and the har1 klv double mutant shows no additive nodulation phenotypes [83], indicating that they act in the same signaling pathway for AON (Figure 2B). Mt1CLE2 and Mt1CLE3 peptides, which are homologus to LjCLE-RS1 and LjCLE-RS2 and are expressed in root nodules, inhibit nodulation in M. truncata [84] (Figure 2B). The systemic effects of Mt1CLE2 and Mt1CLE3 on nodulation are mediated by the shoot-expressed LRR-RLK SUPER NUMERIC NODULES (SUNN), a CLV1 homolog [84]. It has been shown that the CLE-CLV-WOX5 pathway controls AON in both Medicago and pea [85] (Figure 2B).

## Box 3. Root Nodulation

Leguminous plants can establish a symbiosis with N-fixing soil bacteria to form symbiotic nodules on roots, which enables the host plants to grow in N-poor soil. Because excessive nodule formation is deleterious to plants in view of the high metabolic cost, the number of nodules is intricately controlled by external and internal factors [98]. While soil nitrate levels are a major environmental factor that regulates nodule formation, autoregulation of nodulation further refines nodulation via long-distance signaling between roots and shoots [98]. A root-derived signal generated by root nodulation is perceived by the shoots, and a subsequent shoot-derived signal limits the number of nodules in the root [98].

## The Roles of CEP1 Homolog and Its Receptor in Regulating Root Nodulation

MitCEP1 acts as a positive regulator of nodule formation independently of AON in Medicago . In  Medicago , overexpression of MtCEP1 promotes nodule formation [45], whereas a loss-of- function mutant of COMPACTROOTARCHITECTURE2 (CRA2), a CEPR1 homolog, displays a reduced number of nodules and is unresponsive to MtCEP1 [86]. These observations indicate that MtCEP1 is a positive regulator of nodulation and that CRA2 may perceive MtCEP1 (Figure 2B). The MtCEP1-MTCRA2 pair suppresses ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2/SKL-mediated ethylene responses during nodulation [86]. MtCEP1-overexpressing plants phenocopy skl mutants [87]. Consistent with these observations, treatment with MtCEP1 counteracts the reduction in nodulation induced by ethylene [86] (Figure 2B).

## Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

A variety of small peptide play roles in coordinating diverse aspects of plant root development, such as primary root mermistem maintenance, protophloem formation during vascular development in the primary root, the systemic N-acquisition response, cell expansion during root growth, LR development under N limitation, LR formation, root hair formation, and root nodulation (summarized in Table 1). Although different classes of peptides play roles in different aspects of root development in different tissues, various other peptides are involved in the same developmental process, including LR development, indicating that crosstalk may take place between these peptides to properly regulate LR formation (see Outstanding Questions). Analysis of crystal structures of peptide-receptor complexes has revealed molecular recognition mechanisms for how peptides specifically bind to their cognate receptors, and also revealed the conserved structural features and structural differences of the receptors which can account for differential receptor-corpexor complex formation [7,10,16,49,50]. CEPs and CLEs act as local signals for regulating LR formation under N limitation [42,44], and CEPs also act as long-distance signals to mediate the N-acquisition response in the primary root [32,33]. What The ClF-GSO pair acts as a barrier surveillance system to guarantee sealing of the Caspian strip network in response to unfavorable mineral conditions [39-41]. Thus some small peptides are particularly adept in the plant adaptation response under adverse soil conditions.

Despite the extensive and growing knowledge on the roles of signaling peptide families in plant root development, the functions of many of these peptides are largely unknown. Because more than 1000 signaling peptide genes are predicted from the arabidopsis genome sequence [88,89], it is expected that new signaling peptides involved in root development will be identified. Moreover, only a small number of peptide-receptor pairs have been shown to play roles in plant root development. Combinations of biochemical assays, two-hybrid screening, genetic approaches, receptor kinase expression library screening and photoafunction, and structural analysis will be useful for identifying new peptide-receptor pairs [14-16]. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting is an approach to overcome the limited number of loss-of-function peptide-encoding gene mutants available owing to their small gene size, and this approach was successfully used to generate a collection of mutants for CLE peptideencoding genes [90]. Although the roles of many of the signaling peptides have been identified in plant root development, most of their downstream signaling pathways remain to be elucidated. Because signaling peptides control plant development, synergistic or antagonistic crosstalk most likely takes place between signaling peptides and conventional plant hormones, such as auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokines, ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid, that need further investigation, while some peptides and conventional plant hormones could act independently of each other to regulate particular aspects of plant development. The roles of peptides involved in plant responses to environmental changes in the root have been reported [32,33,40,42,43]. It will be of interest to investigate the function of signaling peptides that

regulate plant root architecture during stress responses. The majority of studies on signaling peptides have been conducted on the model plant arabidopsis, with the exception of root nodulation and root-nematode interactions which have been investigated in  Medicine ,  soy- bean, and pea. Peptide hormone studies need to be further extended to major crop plants such as rice and maize [91,92]. Current trends undoubtedly indicate that signaling peptides, their receptors, and the signaling pathways coordinating plant root development will be one of the major focuses of research in plant hormone biology in the coming years.

have been predicted in the genome sequence of arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) [6], implying that peptide-derived intercellular communication is a prevailing signaling mechanism in plants.

Signaling peptides specifically bind to the extracellular domain of receptors, and the peptidereceptor interaction activates a range of biochemical and physiological processes [2]. To date, the identified receptors for peptide signals belong to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) family [7], particularly the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK, see Glossary) subfamily comprising more than 200 members in arabidopsis [8]. Plant LRR-RLKs usually require shapelocomplementary coceptor proteins for receptor activation. Signaling mediated by LRR-RLKs in many cases involves BRASSINOSTERID INSENSITIVE BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEP- TOR KINASE (BAK1) and somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKS) as coceptors [9-11]. Some LRR-receptor-like proteins (LRR-RLPs)  50 members in arabidopsis) can also function as coceptors [12].

We review here recent advances in the functional understanding of secreted signaling peptides and peptide-receptor pairs and how they initiate signaling activation, focusing in particular on plant root development.

## Signaling Peptides in Primary Root Development

The Roles of RGF Peptides and Their Receptors in Root Meristem Maintenance and the Gravitropic Response

Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification of peptide hormones that is mediated by tyrosine protein sulfotransferase (TPST). The arabidopsis genome has only one TPRST gene, and the loss-of-function mutant tpst-1 shows pleiotropic phenotypes including severely shortened roots with a reduction in root meristem size [13]. Application of synthetic and sulfated ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR 1 (RGF1) peptides restores root meristem activity in the tpst-1 mutant, indicating that this peptide is required for root stem cell maintenance and that sulfation of the tyrosine residue of RGF1 is crucial for its activity [13]. In support, the rgf1 kinase rgf3 rgf3 triple mutant displays a short-root phenotype similar to that of the tpst-1 mutant [13].

Three different groups independently identified receptors for RGFs using biochemical assays based on a signature ligand recognition motif, yeast two-hybrid screening with BAK1 as bait, and a combination of a receptor kinase expression library and photoaffinity labeling, respectively [14-16]. The rgf insensitive (rg1) quintuple mutants display a short primary root with a small-sized meristem [14,15]. The expression of PLETHORA 1 (PLT1) and PLT2 is almost undetectable in rg1 quintuple mutants, and ectopic expression of PLT2 in the quintuple mutant rescues the root meristem defects [14]. Genetic and expression analysis also showed that RGF1R, RGF2R, and RGF3R are required for maintaining proper gradients of PLT transcription factors in the proximal meristem [15]. Thus, the RGF1 receptors essentially hold in essential roles on PLT-mediated root meristem development [14,15]. However, it remains to be clarified whether all five RGFRs are bonafide receptors that recognize the RGF1 peptide in vivo. Structural analysis and mutation studies revealed that the Arg-X-Gly-Moth is responsible for specific recognition of the sulfate group of RGF1 by RGFR1, and is important for RGFRs to distinguish RGFs from other similar peptides [16]. Gelfiltration and coimmunoprecipitation analyses showed that RGF1 induces the interaction between RGF1 or RGF2R and SERK1/2/BAK1 [16]. Consistent with this, serk1 multiple mutants exhibit the phenotypes observed in the rgf1 and rgf1, 2,3 mutants, such as smaller meristems and shorter roots than wild-type plants [16]. These serk mutants, except for serk2 bak1 , have lost most of their responsiveness to RGF1 [16], indicating that SERks are important for RGF1-induced signaling and act as coceptors for RGFRs to regulate root meristem development. Together, these results have revealed a

## BRASSINOSTERID INSENSITIVE

1 (BRI1): the plasma membrane receptor protein for BR; belongs to the family of LRR receptor serine/ threonine kinases.

peptide signaling pathway in which RGF peptides regulate primary root meristem activity through PLT transcription factors by interacting with RGFRs/BAK1 receptor pairs (Figure 2A).

Deregulation of the RGF/GOLVEN (GLV)/CLAVATA 3 (CLV3)/EMBROYO SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-RELATED (CLE)-LIKE (CLEL) function by gain-of-function and loss-of function mutations impaired the formation of auxin gradients and the gravitropic response, indicating that some GLV peptides, such as GLV1/RGF6/CLE6, GLV2/RGF9/CLE9, and GLV3/RGF4, are also involved in the gravitropic response by controlling the distribution of auxin [17]. Peptide treatments and mutant analysis suggested that RGF/GLVs control the abundance and trafficking dynamics of the auxin efflux carrier PINFORMED 2 in the root merist by a posttranscriptional mechanism [17]. However, because no defects in gravitropic response have been noted in rgfr quintuple mutants [14,15,16], further investigation will be necessary to confirm the role of RGF1 and RGF1 receptor pairs in the gravitropic response. Two related subtilase genes, AtSBT67 and AtSBT6.2, have been identified to produce the mature bioactive GLV1 peptide [18].

The Roles of CLE Peptides and Their Receptors in Root Meristem Maintenance and

Root meristem maintenance is also regulated by CLE peptides. These CLE peptides have a conserved 12-14 aa CLE motif near the C-terminus [19]. Thirty-two CLE peptide genes have been identified in arabidopsis, and their peptides can be divided into two groups: type A CLEs and type B CLEs [20]. Type A CLE peptides regulate root meristem development, whereas type B CLE peptides are involved in vascular development. CLE40, a type A CLE peptide and the closest homolog of CLV3, is required for differentiation of columnella cells, because the cLE40 loss-of-function mutant exhibits a short-root phenotype with irregularly shaped root tips owing to the delayed differentiation of columnella cells [21]. Both cLv1 and arabidopsis kindly 4 (acr4) single mutants have additional columnella stem cell layers, and acr4 is insensitive to the CLE40 peptide [21,22], indicating that CLV1 and ACR4 receptor kinases mediate CLE4 signaling. CLV1 and ACR4 form homo- and heterodimeric complexes [22]. A synthetic CLE-domain peptide of CLE40 can bind to CLV1 in vitro [23]. Thus the heterodimeric CLV1-ACR4 receptor complex may recognize CLE40 peptide. Homeodomain protein WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) 5 acts in the quiescent center (QC) to maintain adjacent columnella stem cell activity [24]. WOX5 expression is altered in the cLE40 mutant, and extends beyond the QC, but is reduced in the QC when CLE40 levels are increased [21], indicating that CLE40 suppresses WOX5 expression to control distal stem cell homeostasis. These results suggest that the CLE40-ACR4-WOX5 signaling pathway is important for maintaining the stem cell niche and for controlling columnella cell development (Figure 2A).

Some CLEs control primary root growth through the regulation of protophloem formation during vascular development in arabidopsis [25-28]. The roots of arabidopsis LR-RK gene barley any meristem 3 (BAM3) mutants specifically resist protophloem differentiation and growth inhibition by CLE45 peptide, indicating that suppression of protophloem differentiation and root meristem growth by CLE45 requires BAM3 [25]. Genetic analysis indicated that quantitative interplay between two opposing signaling pathways of BAM3-mediated CLE45 and OCTUPUS (OPS) determines cellular commitment to protophloem sieve element fate [26]. BAM3 has been shown to be a bona fide CLE45 receptor, acting independently of SERKIs [28]. However, CLV2 and the pseudokinase CORYNE (CRN) are required to fully sense root-active CLE peptides, including CLE45, possibly by stabilizing the expression of their receptors, although CLV2 and CRN are not involved in the direct perception of CLE peptides [28].

Among the various synthetic CLE peptides tested for the arabidopsis root response, CLE26 is the most effective in inducing the short-root phenotype [29]. Arabidopsis CLE26 also affects the root architecture of monocot plants such as Brachypodium distachyon and wheat, as well as of other agriculturally important species such as Brassica napus and Solanum lycopersicum , indicating that the role of CLE26 in regulating root architecture is conserved in monocot and other crop species [29,30]. CLE26 expression is increased by auxin treatment and, conversely, CLE26 decreases the abundance of auxin transporter PIN1 protein without affecting PIN1 transcript levels, indicating that auxin signaling is connected to the CLE26 pathway at the protein level [30].

The CEP-CEPR pair in the shoot generates mobile N-demand signals to systemically upregulate the nitrate transporter genes in the roots [32]. Recently, it was revealed that the phoem- specific polypeptides, CEP DOWNSTREAM 1 and 2 (CEPD1 and CEPD2), are the descending shoot-to-root mobile signals and are induced by the perception of CEP1 by CEPR1 [33]. The resulting CEPD peptides are then translocated to the roots and upregulate expression of the nitrate transporter gene NRT2. 1 [33] (Figure 2A).

The Roles of PSK and PSY1 Peptides and Their Receptors in Cell Expansion during Root Growth

The tyrosine-sulfated peptides, phytosulfokine (PSK) and PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY1), can promote primary root growth by regulating cell expansion in the elongation/differentiation zone (Figure 2A). PSK is a secreted 5 aa sulfated peptide that was initially identified as a growth-promoting peptide in plant cell cultures [3]. PSY1 is an 18 aa secreted sulfated glycopeptide that significantly promotes cellular proliferation and expansion at nanomolar concentrations [34]. Two LRR-RKs, PSKR1 and PSKR2, recognize PSK, and their homolog PSY1R is required for PSY1 perception [34]. Analysis of pskr1 pskr2 double mutants and pskr1 pskr2 myri tri peptide mutants indicated that the LRR-RKS integrate growthpromoting signals mediated by two structurally distinct peptides, PSK and PSY1 [34]. The PSKRs have kinase, guanylate cyclase, and Ca 2+ / CaM-binding activities that are essential for the PSK response [35,36]. PSKR1-deficient protoplasts do not expand in response to PSK but are still responsive to cGMP [37], suggesting that cGMP acts downstream of PSKR1. The roots of de-etiolated bak1 mutant seedlings are unresponsive to PSK, and bak1 protoplasts expand less in response to PSK but are fully responsive to cGMP [37], indicating that BAK1 acts in the PSK signaling pathway upstream of cGMP. Yeast two-hydrid and colocalization assays indicated that PSKR1 interacts with BAK1/SERK3 [37]. Structural, biochemical, and genetic evidence suggests that PSK binding to PSKR stabilizes the PSKR island domain and enhances PSKR heterodimerization with the SerKS [10].

The Roles of CIF1/CIF2 Peptides and Their Receptors in Casparian Strip Formation The Caspian strip functions as a hydrophobic barrier embedded within the walls of endodermal cells to prevent passive apoplastic diffusion of ions and water across the endodermis in the root. Two endodermis-expressed LRR-RKs, SCHENGEN 3 / GASHO 1 (SGN3/GSO1) and GSO2, are required for contiguous Caspian strip formation [38]. Recently, peptides that directly bind to these LRR-RKS, CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTOR 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, were identified [39,40]. Mutants devoid of CIF peptides are defective in Caspian strip formation and exhibit severely stunted growth at high concentrations of iron, but these defects are fully restored by the application of CIF1 peptide [40]. The expression of CIF1 and CIF2 is upregulated by excess iron and is further synergistically regulated by lowering the pH of the medium, making iron more soluble, indicating that this response may reflect an adaptation to ensure the growth and survival of the plants under unfavorable mineral conditions [40]. SGN1, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, is required to transduce CIF1-activated SGN3 signals [39,41]. However, SGN1 is observed exclusively at the outer, cortex-facing side of the endodermal plasma membrane, whereas CIF1 peptides are produced in inner, stellar cell layers [39,41]. Thus the CIF-SGN3-SGN1 signaling module operates only when the Caspian strip is not established. Once sealed, CIFs will no longer be able to reach the domain where SGN3 and SGN1 can colocalize, leading to strongly reduced signaling. However, this signaling module will be reactivated whenever the endodermal diffusion barrier becomes compromised. Therefore, the CIF-GSO pair acts as a barrier surveillance system to guarantee sealing of the Caspian strip network in response to root developmental cues and adverse soil conditions [39-41] (Figure 2A).

## Signaling Peptides in Lateral Root (LR) Development

The Roles of CLE and CEP Peptides and Their Receptors in N-Responsive LR Growth Some CLE peptides function in LR growth in response to changing levels of N in soil. CLE7 , CLE3 , CLE4 , and CLE7 are expressed predominantly in the pericycle , and their expression in arabidopsis roots is downregulated by N supply, and is upregulated by low levels of N [42]. Overexpression of these CLE genes inhibits LR growth [42], indicating that these CLE peptides act as negative regulators of LR growth. Because the c/v1-1 mutant has longer LRs under low- N conditions, CLV1 may be a receptor for CLE peptides [42]. Root-specific expression of CLE3 inhibits LR formation in the wild type but not in the c/v1 mutant, indicating that CLE-dependent inhibition of LR formation requires CLV1 [42]. These results show that a CLE-CLV1 signaling module is important in the regulation of LR growth in response to changing levels of N in the soil (Figure 2A).

CEP1 is expressed in the LR primordia, and overexpression of CEP1 inhibits LR growth in arabidopsis [31]. Application of synthetic CEP peptides, such as CEP1, CEP3, and CEP9, disrupts LR development [31,43]. CEP5 has also been shown to function as a negative regulator of LR formation [44]. In the legume Medicago trattuala , MtECP1 also acts as a negative regulator of LR formation [45]. CEP genes are responsive to various abiotic stress conditions to varying degrees in roots [43]. In particular, CEP3 expression is highly upregulated by N limitation in roots. The cep3 mutant shows increased LR growth under a range of abiotic stress conditions, such as N limitations and salt and osmotic stress, and thus CEP3 may mediate environmental regulation of LR growth [43]. Two CEPR receptor kinases, CEPR1/XYLEM INTERMIXED WITH PHLOEM 1 (XIP1) and CEPR2, bind to several members of the CEP family [32,44]. Consistent with a role for CEPs in inhibiting LR growth, cepr1 and cepr1 cep2 mutants exhibit enhanced LR growth [32], indicating that the CEP1-CEP1R/XIP1 module is important for controlling LR growth (Figure 2A). However, the CEP5-CEP1R/XIP1 interaction occurring at phloem pole pericyle cells seems to be an antagonistic peptide-receptor pair interaction in LR initiation (Figure 2A) because CEP5 overexpression reduces LR density in a similar manner to the cepr1/xip1 mutant, which displays a reduction in stages I and II LR primordia [44]. Therefore, two different peptides, CEPs and CLEs, inhibit LR growth and development in response to N limitation by interacting with their own distinct receptors.

CEP5 produced under local N limitation act as long-distance signals through shoot-located CEPR1/XIP1 to generate CEPD1 and CEPD2, the descending mobile signals, to upregulate high-affinity nitrate transporter genes in roots [32,33]. CEP5 acts locally to inhibit LR initiation, which is dependent on root-located CEPR1/XIP1 [44]. Thus CEP5 can have both long-distance and local effects on root response acting via receptors located in different plant tissues.

The Roles of TDIF Peptide and Its Receptor in LR Formation A recent study showed that the TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR (TDIF)-TDIF RECEPTOR/PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (TDR/PXY- BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2)-AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) signaling pathway plays a role in LR formation [46] (Figure 2A and Box 1). TDIF is a 12 aa peptide containing two hydroxyproline residues, and is encoded by CLE41 and CLE44 [47]. TDIF is secreted from the phloem and perceived by TDR in xylem pole pericyle cells [46]. In the presence of TDIF, TDR interacts with BIN2 in the pericyle and enhances BIN2-mediated phosphorylation of ARFs to activate the ARFs [46]. Phosphorylation of ARFs interferes with interactions between ARFs and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IJAA), negative regulators of ARFs, allowing the formation of active ARFs that promote LR formation [46]. Treatment with TDIF increases LR density in a dose-dependent manner, and tdr mutant is insensitive to

## Box 1. Lateral Root Development

Plant roots are mainly divided into primary roots and LRs. The primary root is formed from the radicle of the seed and grows vertically downwards into the soil, and is essential for anchorage to the soil and for absorbing water and nutrients. LRs are a major determinant of the root architecture in plants and are thus crucial for the uptake of water and nutrients [93]. In Arabidopsis thaliana LRs originate from founder cells formed from xylem pole pericyle cells primed in the basal meristem, and these cells undergo anticalin and asymmetric division to create a single-layered primordium for LR initiation [94]. A series of coordinated periclinal and anticalin divisions of this primordium give rise to a highly organized dome-shaped LR primordium that emerges from the primary root via cell separation. The plant hormone auxin plays crucial roles in nearly every step of LR formation [95]. Many components involved in LR development and signaling pathways have been identified in arabidopsis, including AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACITIC ACID-AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR modules via auxin transporters [95].

the TDIF treatment and exhibits altered LR density, showing that the TDIF-TDR pair functions in LR formation [46]. TDIF also activates the glycogen synthase kinase pathway, promoting cellular differentiation into tracheary elements [48]. The crystal structures of the TDR-TDIF complex revealed the recognition mechanism of TDIF by TDR [49,50]. A comparison of structures of plant LRR-RKs and their ligand complexes revealed conserved structural features among the plant LRR-RK family members, such as twisted superhelical structures and the Nterminal capping domain [7,49,50]. However, TDR has notable structural differences from other plant LRR-RKs, such as lack of an insertion domain for ligand-dependent heterodimerization with BAK1, and shorter LRR domains, such that TDR-TDIF forms a heterodimer with SERK1 but not with BAK1. By contrast, BR1 forms a ligand-dependent heterodimer with the cercopter BAK1 in which the ligand brassinolide is sandwiched between BR11 and BAK1, serving as molecular glue [51].

## The Roles of GLV/RGF/CLEL Peptides in LR Formation

Of 11 GLV/RGF/CLEL family members, 10 GLV genes are expressed during LR development in arabidopsis [18,52]. Overexpression of most GLV genes results in various root defects, including reduction in the number of emerging LRs and defects in pericyle cell division, while no detectable changes in LR formation occur in single loss-of-function mutations in each GLV gene [52-54]. Application of synthetic GLV peptides produces similar phenotypic changes in the wild type to those produced by GLV overexpression [53,54]. Thus, many of the GLV peptides likely play roles in LR development in arabidopsis. Analysis of multiple glv mutants will provide clues to the biological roles of GLV peptides in LR formation. RGF1 treatment greatly reduces LR numbers in arabidopsis, and the rg1,2,3,4 quadruple mutant exhibits reduced sensitivity to RGF1 in LR formation compared to the wild type, indicating that the RGF1 and RGF1 receptor pair plays a role in LR formation [14] (Figure 2A).

## The Roles of RALFs during LR Initiation and Emergence

RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTORS (RALFs) belong to the group of CRPs with proteolytic processing [55]. RALF peptides affect cell growth by regulating Ca$^{2+}$ responses, MAPK signaling, and alkalization, and are linked to LR development [55-57]. Overexpression of RALF1 reduces LR density, whereas knockdown of RALF1 expression causes an increase in LR emergence, indicating that RALF1 has a negative regulatory role in LR emergence [57]. RALF1 and other RALFs, such as RALF19 and RALF23, have also been shown to be involved in LR initiation [56,57]. A RALF-LIKE peptide, RALFL34, is involved in regulating LR initiation. RALFL34 is expressed in xylem pole pericyle cells, and ralfl34 mutants exhibit abnormal pericyle division patterns and increased LR density [58], indicating that RALFL34 peptide plays a role in correct cell division in the pericyle during LR initiation.

The Roles of IDA Peptide and Its Receptor in LR Emergence LRs pass through endodermal, cortical, and epidermal cell layers to emerge from the primary root, and therefore cell separation in these tissue layers overlaying the LR primordium is crucial for LR growth and emergence [59]. This emergence process resembles organ abscission , and the INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) peptide, which is involved in floral abscission [60], regulates LR emergence [61]. The auxin influx carrier-like AUX1-3-derived auxin in the neighboring cortical and epidermal cells triggers degradation of SOLITARY ROOT 1/IA14A, allowing ARFs to promote IDA expression [61]. IDA is perceived by the HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2) LRR-RLRs [62], and facilitates cell-wall degradation by inducing the expression of various cell-wall remodeling enzymes, promoting LR emergence [61] (Figure 2A). SERK1 acts as a HAESA coreceptor and promotes high-affinity IDA-sensing during floral organ abscission [63]. Genetic analyses revealed that all four SERK family RLKs function redundantly in regulating floral organ abscission upstream of the MAP kinase cascade [64]. IDA induces heterodimerization of HAE/HSL2 and SERKs, which transphosphorylate each other [64]. However, it is not known whether SERKs function with HAE/HSL2 to promote LR emergence. Subtilisin-like proteases form the mature and bioactive IDA from the precursor protein during floral abscission [65] (Figure 1), but it remains to be determined whether the same proteases act to process the IDA precursor protein in LR formation.

The Roles of PSK Peptide in LR Growth and Formation Arabidopsis has five PSK genes that are expressed in the LR primordia [66]. PSK peptides bind to PSKR1 and PSKR2 [67,68], and these PSK-PSK pairs are important for primary root growth [66]. However, exogenous PSK treatment increases LR emergence and total LR length with increased cell size independently of PSKR1. Thus PSK may interact with other receptors to regulate LR development [66].

## Signaling Peptides in Root Hair Formation

The Roles of RALF Peptide and Its Receptor in Root Hair Development RALF peptides regulate root hair development (Box 2). Arabidopsis plants overexpressing RALF1 show inhibited root hair growth [69], and application of synthetic RALF peptides produces a similar effect [70]. RALF peptides stimulate the phosphorylation of H+-ATPase 2 (AHA2) to inhibit its proton pump activity, and the consequent increase in apoplastic pH reduces cell elongation [71], indicating that RALF peptides control root hair formation via the regulation of cell elongation. FERONIA (FER) is a receptor for RALF peptides [72]. The fer knockout mutants exhibit root hair defects and are insensitive to RALF treatment [72,73]. Activation of FER by RALF results in the phosphorylation of AHA2, which increases extracellular alkalinization, reducing cell elongation [71,74] (Figure 2A). FER also interacts with several plantspecific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RGPFs), such as ROPGF4 and ROPGF10, to activate the plant RHOGPTES (RAC/ROP) signaling pathway [72,73,75,76] (Figure 2A). Regulated RAC/ROP activity controls the production of NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) [72], and spatially regulated accumulation of ROS leads to enhancement of polarized root hair growth [73] (Figure 2A). The RALF-FER pair requires additional components, such as LORELEI-LIKE-GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) and RPM1-induced protein

Box 2. Root Hair Formation

Root hairs are cylindrical outgrowths from root epidermal cells that enable water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and environmental sensing in plants [96]. Root epidermal cells are arranged with alternating cell identities that produce root hairs or not [96]. Intercellular communication is important for specifying trichoblast cells located adjacent to cortical cells for root hair formation [97].
