Our aim is not to modify active TMDs because this modification alters their intrinsic optical properties, which may further degrade the sample stability. Instead, we designed the substrate to enhance the optical gain of active TMD materials. We selected the thickness of the TiO$\_{2}$ spacer layer and surface roughness of the metal film as engineering parameters to enhance the optical gain of the TMD layer. We observed that the PL intensity from monolayer MoS$\_{2}$ is amplified by Fabry- Perot interference, and furthermore, the local field enhancement originating from the surface roughness of the metal film becomes dominant spacer thicknesses of less than ∼ 10 nm and selectively amplifies the neutral exciton peak. We propose that by performing analytic simulations of the transfer matrix method (TMM), the quality (Q$\_{-}$) factor can be engineered by selecting the spacer material to achieve a low Q-factor for broadband systems, such as solar cells and photodetectors, and a high Q-factor for complimentary image sensors with selective bands. This work provides an opportunity to optimize the

performance of optoelectronic devices with various TMD materials such as LEDs, lasers, and nanoantennas.

## RESULTS

Schematics of the optical coupling behavior of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown monolayer MoS$\_{2}$ with the nanostructured substrate are presented in Figure 1a. The incident light is partially absorbed on MoS$\_{2}$ and transmitted further into the metal substrate. The reflected light at the metal substrate is again absorbed partially on MoS$\_{2}$ and reflected at the MoS$\_{2}$/ TiO$\_{2}$ interface. The repetition of absorption and reflection known as Fabry-Perot interference increases the absorption of light in MoS$\_{2}$ to eventually enhance the optical gain, in particular with a thick TiO$\_{2}$ layer. For a thin TiO$\_{2}$ layer, the surface roughness of the metal layer generates a strong local field to enhance the light. Optical gain is attained when the spacer layer is thin enough for MoS$\_{2}$ to feel the short-range local field.

Figure 1b shows the optical absorbance of monolayer MoS$\_{2}$ placed on a TiO$\_{2}$/ Au sample. The overall absorbance was significantly increased with distinct A and B peaks near 1.9 and 2.0 eV, respectively, which is attributed to the Fabry-Perot effect. This contrasts with that without the TiO$\_{2}$ spacer, where no clear A and B peaks are observed with low absorbance. Because of the enhanced absorbance, the PL intensity with the 532 nm excitation laser (3.8 mW, 0.1 s) was enhanced by 15 times while maintaining a similar PL peak shape with the neutral exciton ( A$\_{0}$ ) peak near ∼ 1.89 eV and the B exciton peak near ∼ 2 eV.0 valence-bond splitting due to the strong spin-orbital interaction 19,20 and multiexciton peak ( ∼ 1.85 eV), mainly trion (e-h pair and one electron, A$\_{-}$ ), which is a common feature at high laser power. 21 In contrast to this, the PL peak shape was significantly altered when a thin TiO$\_{2}$ layer (3.5 nm) was deposited on the Cu film. The PL intensity was amplified by 4 times with a spacer; furthermore, the A$\_{0}$ peak was selectively enhanced, whereas the other peaks were significantly diminished, as observed in Figure 1d.

The spacer thickness and metal-type dependences of the PL spectra are clearly demonstrated in Figure 2. The maximum PL

intensity was clearly observed at a spacer thickness of approximately 40 nm, independent of the metal type. The intensity was altered by an order of magnitude within the spacer thickness range of 10 to 90 nm. This result is strongly correlated to the stark optical contrast at similar spacer thickness (see Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1). 14 This simply indicates that the Fabry-Perot effect plays a dominant role in enhancing the PL intensity. The peak shape was not altered with the variation in spacer thickness. The PL intensity reached a maximum for the Ag film because of its highest reflectance in the visible range among the tested metals (see SI, Figure S2).

However, the PL shape changed when the spacer thickness was less than 10 nm. In this case, the surface roughness of the metal film played an important role. To test this effect, we selected a very thin TiO$\_{2}$ oxide layer ( d ≈ 3.5 nm) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and the surface roughness of Cu was modulated using different deposition conditions with a thermal evaporator. 22 The surface roughness was confirmed using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (top panel of Figure 3a). For a flat metal surface, Fabry-Perot interference remained a dominant factor in increasing the PL intensity without altering the shape, similar to the thick spacer. When the rough metal surface was introduced with a very thin oxide layer ( ∼ 3.5 nm), the A$\_{e}$ peak was selectively enhanced by 4.5 times compared with smooth Cu, whereas the trion and B neutral exciton peaks were significantly suppressed.

To confirm this unique selective enhancement of the PL independent of the metal type, we prepared a smooth and rough surface of an Al film with native oxide ( ∼ 10 nm), again confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping and TEM images (Figure 3b). To compare the roughness of the Al film further, we measured the root-meansquare (RMS) roughness using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see SI Figure S3). Large enhancement of the A$^{0}$ peak (more than 22 times) was observed for the rough Al film compared with the smooth Al film. However, the PL enhancement was completely quenched when an additional 10 nm Al$\_{0}$ layer was added to the rough Al surface by ALD. The original PL shape observed on smooth Al was also recovered. The variation of the PL intensity at each step is shown in the inset of the bottom graph in Figure 3b. To guarantee selective PL enhancement, both high surface corrugation and a thin oxide layer should be used.

To investigate the effect of substrate roughness, monolayer MoS$\_{2}$ was directly deposited on the smooth and rough Al surface. The deposited MoS$\_{2}$ on Al does follow the general trend of roughness of the Al surface; that is, the roughness of monolayer MoS$\_{2}$ (0.34 nm) on the rough substrate is higher than that (0.11 nm) on the smooth substrate, although the roughness value of MoS$\_{2}$ on Al is much smaller than the Al

roughness, as shown in Figure S4, as expected. The strain on MoS$\_{2}$ can be induced by the surface roughness of substrate. The strain effect on TMD materials induced by the substrate morphology has been studied by Raman spectroscopy and PL measurement. The E$^{1}$ 2 g peak of MoS$\_{2}$ placed on the rough Al substrate was downshifted, which indicates that the tensile strain is applied to MoS$\_{2}$ due to surface morphology. The PL intensity of MoS$\_{2}$ subjected to tensile strain is usually reduced, and the peak position is re-shifted in the reference. In our case, however, the neutral PL peak intensity was exclusively enhanced, differing from the strain effect. Another possible scenario is the funnel effect that reduces the band gap and enhances PL intensity due to strain, while retaining the line shape of the PL spectrum of monolayer MoS$\_{2}$. 25 This is very different from our PL spectra, again negating the possible funnel effect. Therefore, the origin of the large enhancement of the A 0 peak intensity is not from the tensile strain.

The selectively enhancement of the A 0 peak is associated with Purcell enhancement, which has been observed to be strong when the gain material is placed on a metal nanostructure. 21 The emission enhancement is due to two simultaneous processes. First, the strong local electric field on the rough surface metal nanostructure increases exciton generation in MoS$\_{2}$. To investigate the field distribution around the rough metal surface, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations were conducted for the representative morphology configuration obtained from TEM images of the Cu/TiO$\_{2}$ film. For the rough surface in Figure 4a, the electric

fields were strongly enhanced locally at the edges compared with the relatively smooth surface. Notably, the enhanced electric field around the valley was observed because of the localized surface plasmon effect. Second, the excitonic spontaneous emission rate of generated MoS$\_{2}$ via plasmonic resonant coupling with a metal nanostructure was enhanced, as described by the Purcell effect. The nonresonant Purcell enhancement factor is defined as F$\_{p}$ ≡ F$\_{T}$ = √ T$\_{s}$ = t$\_{s}$/t$\_{p}$ where T$\_{s}$ ( t$\_{s}$ ) and T$\_{s}$ ( t$\_{s}$ ) are the radiative decay rate (lifetime) on a rough and smooth surface in the MoS$\_{2}$/spacer/metal film structure, respectively, 26

$$R = \frac { 2 \pi } { \hbar } \{ ( d E ( r ) ) \} ^ { 2 } \rho ( \omega )$$

where E ( r ) is the electric field, ρ ( θ ) is the density of electromagnetic modes, and d is the electric dipole of the transition. Because Γ$\_{r}$ &gt; Γ$\_{s}$ , the enhanced spontaneous emission of MoS$\_{2}$ on a rough metal film restricts the formation of the trion and B peaks because of the limited band-filling effect. 21 This effect is limited to local positions within a few nanometers, as observed in Figure 4a.

In the very thin spacer regime ( d  10 nm), a flat surface is more favorable because multiple reflections can be provoked more efficiently with a metal film of high re-flection (see SI Figure S2). Otherwise, for optical devices, a very thin oxide layer ( d

To more clearly understand the aforementioned PL enhancement behavior by Fabry-Perot interference, simulations based on the TMM were conducted for the normal incidence of light. The reflectance, transmittance, and field profile of electromagnetic (EM) waves at the interface between layered media can be determined using the product of the matrix according to Maxwell's equations with boundary conditions at each interface. When there are multiple interfaces among adjacent layers, EM waves are partially transmitted and reflected at the interfaces. Thus, destructive or constructive interference, known as Fabry-Perot interference, can occur in layered media. In our case, two important interfaces exist: the air/TiO$\_{2}$ and TiO$\_{2}$/metal interfaces. As shown in Figure Sa, the SiO$\_{2}$ (300 nm), metal film (100 nm), and TiO$\_{2}$ layer (0

The calculated electric field intensity (Γ$\_{E}$I ) is displayed on the horizontal top axis with the normal incident light of 670 nm. The resulting Ε$\_{L}$2 profiles in air are oscillatory along the z -direction. According to Fermi's golden rule, the transition probability ( Γ ) of electrons from the ground state to the excited state is approximately proportional to Γ ≈ | E$\_{E}$I | $^{2}$, where E is the electric field and β is the dipole moment of the exciton. Thus, the PL intensity from the MoS$\_{2}$ layer is roughly proportional to the electric field intensity at z = 0 ( | E$\_{E}$I $^{2}$( z = 0)) where the MoS$\_{2}$ layer is placed. Ε$\_{L}$2 ( z = 0) is calculated as a function of the TiO$\_{2}$ film thickness to determine the optimal thickness of TiO$\_{2}$ for maximum PL enhancement. Figure Sb demonstrates that the electric field intensity at z = 0 reaches a maximum at d ≈ 41 nm. This result is typical for Fabry-Perot interference. Constructive interference in a Fabry-Perot interferometer at the condition occurs at 2 nd cos θ = m$\_{λ}$ , where n is the refractive index of the dielectric material between two reflecting mirrors, d is the separation of the reflecting surfaces, θ is the angle of the incident light measured from the vertical line against the reflecting surface, m is the order of interference, and λ is the wavelength of the radiation in a vacuum. In our case, n ≈ 2 670 nm and θ = 0, the separation difference between two consecutive constructive interferences, d ≈ Δ λ/ 4 , which is ∼ 167 nm. This relation can vary because one of our reflecting surfaces is metal at one side. This was confirmed from the theoretical calculations by TMM in Figure

5b, (Δd)/2-5S nm, which were measured between consecutive constructive and destructive interferences.

Notably, electric field intensity increased in the order of Ag, Cu, Au, and Al, which is in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data in Figure 2b. The electric field intensity is influenced by the reflectance of metals, R = l$\_{R}$ 2 = 1 2 E$\_{e}$ 2 1 2 , where R is reflectance, r is the reflectance coefficient, and E$\_{e}$ ( E$\_{e}$ ) is the reflected (incident) electric field. That is, a metal with strong reflectance indicates a large electric field intensity. In particular, it is remarkable that the optimal thickness with maximum field intensity, d$\_{max}$ ≈ 41 nm, is in excellent agreement with the experimental result.

Electric field intensity contour maps as a function of the wavelength and thickness of the spacer with a low refractive index material (SiO$\_{2}$) and high refractive index material (TiO$\_{2}$) are presented in Figure 5c and, respectively. TiO$\_{2}$ has been utilized as the electron transport layer (ETL) in electroluminescence (EL) devices. 27,28 This result can be applied to optimize EL device performance. For example, for other gain materials emitting different wavelengths, the optimized thick-

ness of TiO$\_{2}$ should then be transformed to maximize the intensity of its luminescence.

In addition, the E-field intensity at the interface between air and the spacer depends on the thickness of the dielectric material; it is also affected by the index of the materials. Generally, a Fabry-Perot structure with a spacer of high refractive index exhibits a high quality (Q) factor, which is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the sharpness of the resonator bandwidth. As the refractive index of the spacer increases, the reflection ( R ) increases. The Q-factor can be described by the equation

$$Q = \frac { 2 n d \mu _ { 0 } R } { c ( 1 - R ^ { 2 } ) }$$

where ν$\_{0}$ is the frequency, R is the reflectivity, d is the thickness of the spacer, and c is the velocity of light. The reflection at the interface between air and spacer is described as

$$R = \frac { n _ { s p a c e r } - 1 } { n _ { s p a c e r } + 1 }$$
