SPECIFICATION of ELECTRONIC VOLTMETERS  

Purpose The purpose of these specifications is to give a common basis of coniparison among electronic voltmeters offered for generalpurpose applications.Itisrecommended thatallmanufacturersofferinginstruments for general applications supply the information outlined. For the purpose of these specifications,general-purpose voltmeters do not include instruments which are primarily intended for measurement of pulses or similar discontinuous waveforms, or instruments of the electrometer type which are designed to provide an extremelyhigh inputresistance( $10^{10}$ ohms or more).It is recognized thatadditional information should be supplied with instruments in these and other special groups which manufacturers should not be asked to supply when they are offering instruments for more general applications.
