{"md_content":"Acheampong's (2020) research highlights the critical role of both public and private stakeholders in the destination branding process, demonstrating that their collaboration is essential to achieving a unified and authentic brand identity. She also identifies key challenges in the case of Cape Coast (Ghana), such as inadequate government support, poor brand communication and lack of infrastructure, and provides a basis for addressing these issues to enhance the destination's brand. Her findings underscore the need for product diversification to maintain tourist interest and offer a variety of experiences that can help maintain the destination's attractiveness and competitiveness in the tourism market.  \n\nAidoo et al. (2024) reveal that place branding significantly influences sustainable development, both directly and indirectly, through enhancing visitor satisfaction. They have found that cultural tourism promotes sustainable development by engaging local communities, with environmental awareness playing a moderating role in this relationship. The research provides actionable insights for policy makers, emphasizing the need to incorporate cultural assets and community involvement in sustainable tourism strategies to achieve balanced economic, social, and environmental outcomes.  \n\nAkoijam and Meitei (2016) identify branding as a critical element in differentiating Manipur from other tourist destinations, which is essential for attracting a larger number of tourists and promoting the state's unique attributes. According to the authors, Manipur has significant potential in various forms of tourism such as Nature-Eco tourism, culture tourism, historical tourism, and adventure tourism, which, if properly branded and promoted, can position it as a top tourist destination. The study emphasizes the need for a unique and modern branding strategy, such as the \"Gateway to South-East Asia\" theme, to effectively market Manipur's tourism potential and ensure its competitiveness in the global tourism industry.  \n\nAlmeyda-Ibáñez and George (2017) provide a comprehensive literature review on destination branding in tourism. They recall that destination branding has gained importance since the late 1990s as a strategic approach for destinations to compete effectively in the global marketplace, and that destination branding is complex due to the unique nature of tourism products, which are a combination of different services and experiences. The paper discusses various approaches to conceptualizing and measuring brand equity, including psychological, economic, and cultural approaches.  According to the authors, measuring the effectiveness of destination branding efforts is challenging but critical, and they propose brand equity as a potential measure of branding effectiveness. They also highlight the challenges of destination branding, including dealing with multiple stakeholders, limited management control, underdeveloped identities, political pressures, and budget constraints. The authors emphasize the importance of authenticity in destination branding, stating  \n\nthat successful brands are those that are honest and valuable in themselves, and argue for the need to develop a comprehensive theory of destination branding to guide management practice and future research.   \nAccording to Bishar and Robertine (2023), branding involves creating a unique identity for a tourism business, while promotion focuses on   \ncommunicating this identity to customers, both of which are crucial in the tourism industry. They stress that every country's tourism sector acts as a brand and contributes significantly to the economy, and that effective tourism branding highlights a destination's unique features, enhances its image and influences tourist preferences. They also emphasize that strong branding is necessary because of the competitive nature of the tourism sector and the need for stakeholders to project a positive image of their destinations, which influences customer awareness and emotional   \nattachment to the place. The authors suggest that countries and their tourism offerings can be likened to products; that successful branding will associate a specific experience, such as pizza with Italy, with a destination; and that understanding factors such as market size and tourist   \ncharacteristics is critical to branding strategies. They insist that creating a strong brand identity for destinations is essential. They further argue that while branding is often associated with products, destination branding encompasses various elements such as culture and history, and that an effective brand identity creates a lasting impression on visitors and is key to managing a destination's image. The authors also propose branding and promotion strategies such as engaging travel influencers (to expand reach and increase visibility); optimizing websites (to increase visibility in search results); creating collaborative packages with hotels and airlines (to   \nincrease tourist appeal); networking events such as trade shows (to   \nfacilitate partnerships and bookings); promoting eco-friendly initiatives (to attract conscious travelers); creating user-generated content (as   \nshowcasing travelers' shared experiences builds trust); and engaging with the local community (to increase visibility and appeal).   \nBlain et al. (2005) propose a refined definition of destination branding that encompasses various themes such as identification, differentiation,   \nexperience, expectations, image, consolidation, reinforcement, recognition, consistency, brand messages, and emotional response. The research   \nidentifies that most DMOs have developed logos, which are primarily used in print literature and videos, and emphasizes the importance of logos in reflecting the destination’s image and attributes. The study also reveals that the logo design process is primarily influenced by DMO executives and marketing managers, with minimal involvement from DMO members, local hospitality firms, and visitors. It suggests that including these stakeholders could enhance the effectiveness of destination branding.  \n\nCampelo et al. (2014) highlight the importance of understanding the local residents' sense of place, which is shaped by time, ancestry, landscape, and community, as a foundational element in destination branding. According to the authors, positioning local residents at the heart of the branding strategy fosters an inclusive and collaborative approach, ensuring that the brand authentically represents the community's values and experiences. The research provides a sense of place model that can be used as a strategic guide for marketers, helping them to identify and leverage social and cultural attributes that enhance the appeal and authenticity of tourism destinations.  \n\nIn his master's thesis, Chikudo (2018) emphasizes that destination branding is a marketing initiative that establishes a distinct identity for a destination. He asserts that destination brand names, logos, and slogans are critical components in achieving competitive advantage. Furthermore, he highlights that brand associations revolve around visitors' perceptions of a specific destination brand. Chikudo also discusses destination brand awareness, emphasizing its significance in marketing strategies. the extent to which tourists can recognize the destination brand; the model of destination branding and competitiveness consists of inherited resources, created resources, supporting resources, and situational conditions; destination branding fosters an emotional attachment and influences tourist behavior through a positive destination image; and that destination image represents the first perception tourists possess of a destination, helping build expectations.  \n\nCoşkun (2021) emphasize the critical role of a positive brand image in attracting tourists and generating revenue for tourist-receiving countries, particularly those heavily reliant on tourism like Türkiye. She stresses the need for more extensive and varied research on the factors influencing destination brand image, including demographic variables, cultural differences, and tourist behavior, as well as the impact of global events like pandemics. She further advances that effective destination branding strategies, including the use of social media and addressing safety concerns, are essential for restoring and maintaining a positive image, which can influence tourists' perceptions and decisions.  \n\nThe research conducted by Ekinci (2003) clarifies the difference between destination image and destination branding, emphasizing that while destination image is cognitive and involves subjective knowledge, destination branding is more about creating an emotional connection. According to the author, effective destination marketing should follow a three-stage process to develop a favorable destination image, with branding being a crucial second stage that involves crafting a unique identity and emotional appeal. The study provides practical examples of successful destination branding, such as 'Brand Western Australia' and $^{1}100\\%$ pure New Zealand,' showcasing how these strategies can position destinations as unique and appealing in the global tourism market.  \n\nGarcía et al. (2012) created a model to brand a destination based on the interests of the people involved. They used this model in Castilla-La Mancha, a region of Spain. The model has three parts: entrepreneurs, local people, and visitors. It looks at four main parts: Presented Brand (PB), Brand Awareness (BA), Brand Meaning (BM), and Brand Equity (BE).Their study adapts Berry's (2000) service-branding model to destination branding.The results show that the CLM Discover & feel brand has major gaps, particularly in entrepreneurs' and visitors' perceptions.They consider that the main weak points in the destination-branding strategy are found in local people and visitors' perceptions. They found that entrepreneurs have significantly higher scores for PB, BA, BM, and BE compared to visitors and local people.The study suggests that destination management organizations (DMOs) should develop a two-stage strategy. First, they should focus on entrepreneurs and local people. Then, they should focus on visitors. They suggest that a brand's equity based on its stakeholders is a better measure for a destination brand than a customer-based approach. They recommend specific actions for DMOs to improve each component of a brand (PB, BA, BM, BE) for each stakeholder group.Finally, they suggest using the SITD as a tool for DMOs to measure and track the effectiveness of their branding strategies over time.  \n\nKladou et al. (2017) found that a destination's name, logo, and tagline have a moderate impact on destination branding, with the name being the most influential of the three. This suggests that these elements alone are not sufficient to create a strong destination brand, in other words, symbolic elements have a limited impact on destination branding. They also emphasize the importance of destination attributes and believe that the primary reasons why visitors choose a destination are related to the inherent attributes and characteristics of the destination itself, rather than promotional elements such as logos and slogans. They suggest that this fact highlights the need for destinations to focus on improving their actual offerings rather than relying heavily on symbolic brand elements. The research further supports the identity-based approach to place branding, emphasizing the importance of aligning branding efforts with the true identity and characteristics of the destination. This approach can lead to more authentic and effective branding strategies that resonate better with potential visitors.  \n\nLund et al. (2018) present a comprehensive framework for integrating social media dynamics into destination marketing strategies. The emphasis on storytelling highlights the need for DMOs to create emotional connections with potential tourists, as stories resonate with audiences on a personal level. In addition, the mention of eWOM reflects the changing landscape of consumer behavior, where trust and peer recommendations have a significant impact on decision-making. The concept of mobilities illustrates the fluid nature of information dissemination in social media. It suggests that DMOs must actively engage with their audiences to ensure that their narratives are shared and reach a wider audience. The technologies of power framework encapsulates the interplay between storytelling and social interactions, suggesting that DMOs must adopt a participatory approach to branding.  \n\nMarzano and Scott (2009) identify persuasion and authority as the primary forms of power used in the VeryGC destination branding process,  \n\nhighlighting how these forms were used to influence stakeholders and advance interests. They argue that, contrary to some theories of collaboration, the use of authority by key figures in the branding process led to, rather than prevented, exclusion and conflict, demonstrating the complex role of authority in stakeholder interactions. The research confirms that power within the Gold Coast tourism destination is concentrated among a few stakeholders, supporting the view that individual tourism operators have significant influence over decision-making processes, as opposed to a more diffuse power structure.  \n\nMiličević et al. (2017) confirm that a well-implemented destination branding process significantly increases destination competitiveness, as evidenced by customer satisfaction in Croatian coastal destinations. They also emphasize awareness of branding strategies, claiming that a significant percentage of surveyed destinations are aware of their competitors' branding strategies $(81\\%)$ , highlighting the importance of competitive analysis in destination branding. The research also shows that effective communication and integration of the brand in all tourism development activities is crucial, as evidenced by the fact that $43\\%$ of destinations integrate their brand in all tourism development activities and $50\\%$ communicate the defined brand to tourists and stakeholders.  \n\nMorgan et al. (2004) assert that the strength of a brand lies in its ability to remain true to its core personality and purpose, which should be consistently reflected in all marketing strategies and visual communications. According to them, developing an integrated visual language that aligns with the brand's core personality, as Western Australia's Brand (WA) has done, helps to enhance the brand's distinctiveness and appeal across industries and geographies. The authors state that maintaining a clear connection to a brand's origins is essential to building brand equity, trust and character, as seen in successful global brands such as Coca-Cola and the cautionary tale of British Airways. Morgan et al. challenge the notion that places are too complex to be included in branding discussions due to multiple stakeholders, lack of managerial control, underdeveloped identities, and lack of public perception as brands. The authors argue that destination branding exists and works, and provide case studies from Europe, North America and Australasia to prove it. They emphasize the importance of delivering powerful experiences, not just building a brand identity, and argue that the Internet offers opportunities for direct communication, but also poses threats of brand confusion and the creation of a price-led commodity market. Munar (2011) emphasizes the influence of tourists in branding, claiming that tourists significantly shape the image of a destination through their narrative, visual, and audio contributions, often bypassing formal branding elements such as slogans and logos. The study also highlights strategic approaches to destination branding, noting that destination management organizations (DMOs) use different strategies - mimetic, promotional and analytical - to manage tourist user-generated content (TCC), with the  \n\nanalytical strategy offering the most potential through intensive IT and knowledge transformation, despite challenges such as community engagement. The study calls for further research into combining different strategic agendas for TCC, understanding the risks associated with TCC, its impact on local communities, and the implications of the analytic model for traditional DMO management.  \n\nNdlovu's (2023) research underscores the importance of building strong brand equity through high brand loyalty, awareness, perceived quality and strong brand associations, which he considers essential for creating competitive advantage in the tourism industry. He also emphasizes the importance of cultural and product association, claiming that consumers tend to associate themselves with products or brands that align with their cultural self-concept. According to the author, this association can have a significant impact on the destination's brand equity and influence tourists' decisions. He goes on to discuss the evolution of brand identity, arguing that successful destination brands must continually reflect and respond to changes in consumer preferences and life stages, while maintaining their core values. He believes that this dynamic brand identity is critical to maintaining long-term brand relevance and appeal.  \n\nPereira et al. (2012) identify definitional inconsistencies between brand image and brand personality, suggesting that brand personality can be seen as a subset or a consequence of brand image, particularly in the context of destinations. The research emphasizes the importance of integrating theories from consumer goods branding and anthropomorphism to develop a comprehensive destination brand personality, reflecting both tangible and intangible aspects of tourist destinations. The paper calls for further research to create a robust measurement model for destination brand personality that incorporates human personality traits, destination brand image elements, and tourists' self-concepts, ensuring a holistic approach to destination branding.  \n\nPereira et al.

The paper calls for further research to create a robust measurement model for destination brand personality that incorporates human personality traits, destination brand image elements, and tourist self-concepts to ensure a holistic approach to destination branding.  \n\nPike (2005) emphasizes the complexity of destination branding by pointing out that destinations are far more multidimensional than consumer goods and services, making it difficult to develop a slogan that effectively captures a destination's multiple attractions and resources. He also addresses stakeholder heterogeneity by highlighting the difficulty of creating a tagline that resonates with the different market interests of different stakeholders, suggesting that DMOs need to balance different geographic markets and segments. He further mentions the role of political influences, pointing out that decision-making processes in destination branding are often influenced by politics and stakeholder dynamics, which can complicate the application of branding theory and affect the outcome of branding efforts.  \n\nQu et al. (2011) indicate the mediating role of overall image. Their study confirms that the overall image of a destination mediates the relationship between brand associations (cognitive, affective, and unique image components) and tourists' future behavior, highlighting the need for a strong overall image to increase tourist loyalty and recommendations. They also reveal the importance of unique image, identifying it as a significant component influencing overall image, second only to cognitive evaluations. According to the authors, this underscores the need for destination branding efforts to focus on creating and highlighting unique aspects of destinations to differentiate them from competitors. They further found that cognitive image is a key influencer. Their findings show that cognitive image, which includes beliefs and knowledge about destination attributes, has the greatest impact on overall image. This finding suggests that destination marketers should prioritize enhancing cognitive perceptions to improve overall destination image and attract more tourists.  \n\nRuiz-Real et al. (2020) identify the main research trends in destination branding, including social media, destination loyalty, word-of-mouth, place attachment, experience, customer-based brand equity, and strategy, and provide a roadmap for future research in the field. The study also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of destination branding research, with contributions from diverse fields such as economics, management, social sciences, environmental sciences, and even engineering and computer sciences, indicating broad relevance and potential for diverse research applications.  \n\nSaraniemi and Ahonen (2008) indicate that despite the potential benefits suggested by corporate branding in destination branding, it is still rarely used, indicating a gap in current research and practice. They identify a need for a commonly accepted framework for destination branding theory due to a lack of current conceptualizations, which the study aims to address by focusing on corporate branding approaches. According to the authors, by understanding a destination brand as co-created and adopting a corporate branding approach, destination management organizations (DMOs) can act more strategically and proactively, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness of their branding efforts.  \n\nSchaar (2013) asserts that destination branding is different from consumer product branding and requires unique strategies that take into account the multidimensional nature of a destination, including its attractions, accommodations, and overall experience. She focuses on emotional appeal, explaining that effective destination branding leverages emotional and inspirational messages, as travel decisions are tied to personal self  \n\nexpression and self-actualization, making destination image a critical component of success. She also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive strategy, explaining that successful rebranding requires collaboration with local stakeholders, extensive research on current perceptions, and targeting markets that value the destination's unique offerings, recognizing that marketers have limited control over the inherent assets of the place. Séraphin et al. (2019) emphasize that while branding is not the sole cause of overtourism, it contributes significantly to increasing visitation and repeat visitors, making it a key factor to consider in sustainable tourism management. Their study suggests that destinations suffering from overtourism should adopt rebranding strategies that focus on core values such as community well-being and cultural preservation, which can help create a more balanced and sustainable tourism environment. They also identify several areas for future research, including the political implications of overtourism, the gap between a destination's romanticized image and reality, and the types of experiences tourists seek in overtourism destinations. The researchers believe that these areas are crucial for developing comprehensive strategies to effectively address overtourism. Tasci and Kozak (2006) identify and address the confusion between brand and image in destination branding, emphasizing the need for a clear definition and understanding of these concepts within the tourism industry. They also highlight the importance of the fit between projected and received images of a destination, suggesting that successful branding relies on a coherent and positive image perception by potential visitors. The research proposes a model for destination branding and offers methodological, theoretical and practical insights that can help develop effective branding strategies and enhance brand equity in the tourism sector.  \n\nVerances et al. (2024) focus on digital engagement, noting that the use of digital technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, increases global awareness and reduces the physical impact on popular tourist sites, illustrating the importance of technology-enabled solutions in sustainable tourism. They also draw attention to cultural integration, recalling that the integration of cultural heritage into urban planning and the adaptive reuse of historic sites helps preserve cultural authenticity while meeting modern needs, demonstrating a balanced approach to urban development and tourism. They further point to policy and community involvement, defending that strong government policies and active community participation are essential to achieving sustainable tourism and city branding goals, and highlighting the need for collaborative efforts among stakeholders.
