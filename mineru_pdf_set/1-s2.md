Individuals aged $>30$ years, males, residing in urban location, and those with past history of TB were more likely to have TB infection. Targeted interventions for prevention of TB and close monitoring are essential to reduce the burden of TB in India.  \n\n$\\copyright$ 2023 The Author(s).

Globally, an estimated 10 million people develop TB and over a million deaths occur annually [1]. India accounts for about $25\\%$ of global TB burden, with an estimated TB incidence of 2.77 million in 2022 [2]. India is committed to end TB by 2025 [3]. In this context, it becomes imperative to address Latent TB infection (LTBI) which is the immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in the absence of clinically ac­ tive TB [4]. A mathematical modelling study estimated 1.7 billion with LTBI globally in 2014 [5]. Individuals with TB infection can subsequently break down to TB disease. The lifetime risk of devel­ oping TB in healthy individuals is $5-10\\%$ which however increases in the presence of co-existing conditions such as HIV, undernutrition, diabetes and habits which include smoking and alcohol use [4,6]. Annual risk of TB infection in India by Tuberculin skin test (TST) surveys has been reported as $1.5\\%$ in 2005 [7]. Studies in India have quantified the magnitude of TB infection in high-risk groups for TB which include household contacts, diabetes mellites, rheumatoid arthritis, refugees, health care workers [8–14]. In a TB endemic country like India, it is essential to understand the current burden of TB infection at the population level. A critical component of End TB strategy is treatment of LTBI to prevent active TB disease [15]. The objective of the present analysis is to estimate the prevalence of TB infection among general population in India. The factors associated with TB infection were explored.  \n\n# Methods  \n\nIndividuals who were tested for TB infection by Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) in the National TB prevalence survey in India were included in this sub-group analysis. In brief, the TB prevalence survey which was a cross-sectional study was conducted in 443 clus­ ters across India during the period 2019–2021 to estimate the pre­ valence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB in those aged $>15$ years. Participants willing for the study were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule after obtaining informed consent. Data on demographic profile, social habits, co-morbid conditions, health-seeking behaviour, TB treatment, symptoms were collected. Chest x-ray was taken for all survey participants except those bedridden or pregnant. Body weight $(\\mathrm{Kg})$ and height (cm) was recorded. Point of care blood test for blood sugar and haemoglobin was done. Study participants were eligible for sputum collection if they had symptoms suggestive of TB, if on current TB treatment or with a past history of TB or with abnormal chest x-ray. CBNAAT, liquid culture and smear microscopy was done in the sputum specimen. Chest x-ray reading was done by Medical Officer and by Tele radiologist.  \n\n# Blood test for IGRA  \n\nIGRA testing was planned in 52 clusters which were proportio­ nately distributed based on the total number of clusters in the National TB prevalence survey in each of the 20 State groups. Within each State group, the clusters were randomly selected for IGRA testing. Out of the 52 clusters, we were able to conduct IGRA testing in 26 clusters at the National level due to COVID-19 pandemic, covering atleast one cluster in every state group. The distribution of Districts with clusters tested for TB infection by IGRA across India is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Quantiferon -TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay was done as per the Manufacturers protocol by trained personnel. The cut-off value was $0.35~\\mathrm{IU/ml}$ [16].  \n\n# Operational definitions  \n\nTB Infection – Individuals positive by QFT-Plus assay (value $>0.35$ $\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{ml})$ [16].  \n\nTB uninfected - Individuals negative by QFT-Plus assay.  \n\nTB disease - Bacteriological evidence for TB by two tests (CBNAAT/smear/liquid culture) Or in one test and Chest $\\mathbf{X}$ -ray ab­ normality.  \n\nSmoker – History of smoking in the past or current.  \n\nAlcohol user – History of alcohol use in the past or current.  \n\nDiabetes – Self reported or having random blood sugar $\\geq200\\mathrm{mg/dl}$ .  \n\nBelow Poverty Line (BPL) - Self reported based on availability of BPL card issued by the Government.  \n\n![](images/f729e4e243c7337e507f1771078f9b0ee2dc2b4b91a6749bc3e9071886e0dc30.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Distribution of Districts with clusters tested for TB infection by Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)  \n\nStatistical analysis  \n\nData was verified for duplication, outlier and logical validation was done prior to analysis. All the statistical analysis was done using Stata16 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive analysis for summarizing the characteristics of survey participants is expressed as percentages and rates per 100 with $95\\%$ Confidence in­ tervals (CI) using the exact binomial formula. To identify the factors associated with TB infection, a post-hoc analysis was conducted using generalised linear models, binomial and poisson regression along with log link functions. Variables known to be associated with TB infection were chosen based on the data availability, identified by literature review and post-hoc by exploratory data analysis. We cal­ culated the estimates such as prevalence, prevalence ratio (PR) and adjusted risk ratio (aRR) estimates with $95\\%$ confidence intervals (CIs) using the Stata “svy” commands to adjust for design effect. All the statistical analyses were two-sided, with a type I error set at alpha $=0.05$ .  \n\n# Results  \n\nThere were 20804 individuals eligible in the clusters selected for IGRA of which IGRA testing was done for 16952 $(81.5\\%)$ [Fig. 2]. The population considered for the present analysis included 16864 $(99.5\\%)$ of the 16952 tested with IGRA. Those on TB treatment during the survey ${\\mathrm{(n=27)}}$ , diagnosed as TB during the survey ${\\big(}\\mathtt{n}=51{\\big)}$ ), on TB treatment and diagnosed as TB in the survey $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{n}}=10)$ were excluded from the analysis.  \n\n![](images/1ac5450a6ce1f8e8ca2c88cde8be1dd6661b0ea2eaedcd4f6e418420dd22f4fd.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Flow chart of TB infection status of survey participants tested by Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)  \n\nBaseline characteristics  \n\nOf the 16864 analysed, 6546 $(38.8\\%)$ were aged 15–34 years, 6255 $(37.0\\%)$ aged 35–54 years and 4063 $(24.0\\%)$ aged $>55$ years (Table 1). There were 9661 $(57.3\\%)$ females, 11831 $(70.2\\%)$ were lo­ cated in the rural area, 7664 $(45.4\\%)$ were employed and 9734 $(57.7\\%)$ were below poverty line (BPL). Smokers constituted 1395 $(8.3\\%)$ and 1644 $(9.7\\%)$ reported alcohol use. There were 1005 $\\left(6.0\\%\\right)$ individuals with diabetes, 951 $(5.6\\%)$ who were hypertensive while HIV status was unknown for 16047 $(95.2\\%)$ . Body mass index (BMI) of $<18.5\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $>23\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ was observed in 3782 $(22.4\\%)$ and 6532 $(38.7\\%)$ respectively. There were 391 $(2.3\\%)$ individuals with past history of TB (Table 1).  \n\n# Prevalence of TB infection  \n\nOf the 16864, QFT-G assay was positive in 3977 $(23.6\\%)$ , negative in 11694 $(69.3\\%)$ and indeterminate in 1193 $(7.1\\%)$ [Fig. 2]. The crude prevalence of TB infection was $23.6\\%$ $95\\%$ CI:22.9 −24.2) and adjusted prevalence of TB infection was $22.6\\%$ $95\\%$ CI:19.4 −25.8) (Table 2).  \n\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of individuals tested by Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) for TB infection in the survey.   \n\n![](images/571c99ebaa25b0c54981d74abffde831c244eaa38332f11af36108881e12e83e.jpg)  \n\nThe prevalence of TB infection was $21.7\\%$ ( $95\\%$ CI: 18.4 – 25.0) in males and $19.7\\%$ $95\\%~\\mathsf{C I}{:}16.9-22.5)$ in females (Table 2). The pre­ valence was $12.8\\%$ $95\\%$ CI: 9.8–15.8) in the 15–24 years age group, $29.3\\%$ $95\\%$ CI: $25.9-32.8)$ in the 45–54 years age group and $28.7\\%$ $95\\%$ CI: $25.7\\:-\\:31.7;$ in those aged $>65$ years (Table 2). The pre­ valence of TB infection was $7.4\\%$ $95\\%$ CI: $5.6\\textrm{--}9.6\\textrm{)}$ in West Bengal and $61.2\\%$ ( $95\\%$ CI: 57.0 – 65.3) in Delhi (Table 2).  \n\nFactors associated with TB infection  \n\nThe factors associated with TB infection were analysed in 15671 $(92.9\\%)$ of the 16864 individuals for whom data was available (Table 3). Of the 15671, there were 3977 $(25.4\\%)$ with TB infection and 11694 $(74.6\\%)$ TB uninfected. In the multivariate analysis sig­ nificant factors more likely associated with TB infection include age $>30$ years, being male, residing in urban location, and past history of TB (Table 3).  \n\n# Subclinical TB and TB infection  \n\nOf the total 61 diagnosed with TB in the IGRA clusters, 37 $(60.7\\%)$ were asymptomatic (sub-clinical TB) [Fig. 3]. IGRA testing was done for all the 65 household contacts of the 37 asymptomatic TB pa­ tients. Of the 65 tested by IGRA, 18 $(27.7\\%)$ had TB infection (Fig. 3). There were $24\\mathrm{TB}$ patients with symptoms in the IGRA cluster and 40 of their household contacts had IGRA testing done. Of the 40 household contacts, $11(27.5\\%)$ had TB infection.  \n\n# Discussion  \n\nThe present analysis has provided an estimate of 226 per 1000 $(22.6\\%)$ for the burden of TB infection in India for population aged $>15$ years. The recent systematic review and meta-analysis con­ cluded $24.8\\%$ global prevalence of LTBI based on IGRA [17]. The IGRA based LTBI prevalence for the South East Asia region was reported as $36\\%$ ( $95\\%\\mathrm{CI}$ : 25.3 – 46.7) [17]. A population-based study among 1319 individuals aged $>15$ years in Vietnam documented LTBI of $36.8\\%$ $(95\\%\\mathrm{Cl}33.4-40.3)$ [18]. Population based studies which have re­ ported LTBI based on IGRA include China $24.3\\%$ $\\mathrm{\\acute{\\mu}n}=2169\\mathrm{\\acute{\\mu}}$ ), Saudi Arabia $9.1\\%$ $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{n}=1369)$ and United States $4.8\\%$ $\\mathrm{\\check{n}}=6083$ ) [19–21]. Our findings that about one-fourth of the population has TB infection in India is a matter of concern and needs to be addressed in the context of TB elimination.  \n\nMales were more likely to have TB infection as observed in our analysis. Higher TB infection rates among males has been reported in earlier studies [18,19]. This possibly could be attributed to socio­ logical factors [19]. A meta-analysis which included 2.2 million from 56 TB prevalence surveys over 28 countries concluded that TB pre­ valence is higher among men than women [22]. These findings imply that active case finding to be strengthened in men for detection of TB.  \n\nThe prevalence of TB infection increased as age advanced in the present analysis. This observation has been reported in previous studies too [18,19]. Similar observation has been reported from an earlier study in household contacts which documented LTBI pre­ valence of $77\\%$ in individuals aged 15–18 years and $85\\%$ in persons aged $>45$ years [9]. Increased frequency of social contacts and use of public transits leading to increased exposure could be contributing to higher LTBI prevalence with advancing age [9]. These findings suggest that older age groups need to be sensitized about TB, TB case detection be actively undertaken and be considered for intervention with TB preventive therapy.  \n\nGeographical differences in the prevalence of TB infection were observed in the current analysis. This could be attributed to the geographical differences in the prevalence of TB which is mirrored by TB infection. States especially those with high TB infection rates $(>30\\%)$ which include Delhi, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh, Karnataka have to identify the possible reasons and plan appropriate targeted interventions. Individuals residing in urban location were more likely to have TB infection in the present ana­ lysis. Annual risk of TB infection of $2.2\\%$ in the urban compared to $1.3\\%$ in the rural areas has been reported in an earlier study from India [7]. This could be attributed to overcrowding, slums, migrant population in urban settings. Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilisation (ACSM) activities pertaining to TB and active case finding has to be strengthened in urban settings.  \n\nIndividuals with past history of TB were more likely to have TB infection in this analysis. This is anticipated since prior sensitization with M.tuberculosis is likely to be IGRA positive. This enforces that individuals with past history of TB have to be closely evaluated by active case finding periodically and considered for TB preventive strategies.  \n\nBody mass index was not associated with TB infection in the present analysis. Undernutrition leads to poor immune response and tests for LTBI are likely to be negative. Undernutrition fuelling the TB burden is well documented and WHO estimated that globally, 1.9 million TB cases are attributed to undernutrition [23]. Cognizant of the burden of undernutrition and TB, the TB programme of India has introduced Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for nutritional support to TB patients (Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana) [24]. Individuals with low BMI in the community have to be counselled for appropriate nutritional intake, periodically screened for TB for early case detection and if required offered TB preventive strategies which warrants further evaluation.  \n\nWe observed that smoking and or alcohol use not to be asso­ ciated with TB infection. Nevertheless, it has been reported that al­ cohol use disorders and smoking attribute 0.74 and 0.73 million TB cases respectively worldwide [23]. TB programme of India offers counselling, linkage to de-addition centres and tobacco cessation services including social support systems to TB patients with smoking and alcohol use [24]. ACSM activities for community sen­ sitization on the adverse effects of smoking and alcohol use needs to be strengthened along with providing relevant information on in­ terventions available for quitting.  \n\nDiabetes is a potential risk factor for TB and WHO has estimated 0.37 million TB cases to be attributed to diabetes [23]. In the present analysis we did not observe diabetes mellites to be associated with TB infection or disease. HIV being a potent risk factor for TB could not be analysed since status of HIV was unknown in $95.2\\%$ of the population in our study.  \n\nTable 2 Prevalence of TB infection by gender,age group and state groups.   \n\n![](images/7e193a2897a6c4dcf94888b778e4c75873c02a7ca77d85c701b0762f85533c43.jpg)  \nTBI – TB infection; CI – Confidence Interval; NA – Not applicable AP - Andhra Pradesh; AN – Andaman & Nicobar; NE – Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim; BR – Bihar; CG – Chhattisgarh; CHChandigarh, DL – Delhi; DN - Dadar & Nagar Haveli; DD – Daman & Diu; GJ – Gujarat; GA – Goa; HR – Haryana; HP - Himachal Pradesh; JH – Jharkhand; JK – Jammu & Kashmir; KA – Karnataka; KL – Kerala; LD – Lakshadweep; MP - Madhya Pradesh; MH – Maharashtra; OD – Odisha; PB – Punjab; PY – Pondicherry; UK – Uttarakhand; RJ – Rajasthan; TN - Tamil Nadu; TS – Telangana; UP - Uttar Pradesh; WB - West Bengal Adjustment for clustering (design effect)  \n\nTable 3 Factors associated with TB infection in the individuals tested by Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA).   \n\n![](images/936aa4b3727f7f963968228046fb48b8f6ae945d3addde0b342217bf63544aef.jpg)  \nPR – prevalence ratio; aRR – adjusted risk ratio; CI – Confidence Interval  \n\nIrrespective of subclinical or symptomatic TB in those diagnosed with TB in the survey, $27\\%$ of their household contacts had TB in­ fection. An earlier systematic review of 95 studies from low and middle- income countries documented $51.5\\%$ $95\\%\\mathrm{CI}$ : $47.1-55.8\\%)$ latent TB infection among contacts of TB patients [25]. This under­ scores the importance of TB preventive therapy (TPT) in contacts of TB patients as recommended by the TB program of India [26]. In­ dividuals with subclinical TB could contribute substantially to the ongoing transmission of M.tb [27]. More than half of the TB patients diagnosed in the survey had subclinical TB which is absence of TB symptoms but abnormal chest radiograph and or bacteriological evidence of TB. Though this was a cross-sectional analysis and the number of contacts tested for TB infection is small, the possibility that subclinical TB is transmissible cannot be ruled out. Our ob­ servation that transmissibility of subclinical TB is similar to symp­ tomatic TB needs to be explored in future studies.  \n\nThis analysis has inherent limitations. The numbers may not be sufficient for sub-group analysis of factors associated with TB in­ fection. The findings have to be interpreted considering this limita­ tion. Information on potential factors for TB infection such as contact with TB patient, duration of exposure, biomass fuel use, HIV status and other immunosuppressive conditions was not available. Moreover, information on the time of infection – recent $/$ past could not be elucidated.  \n\nOur analysis has shown that in India, about one fourth $(22.6\\%)$ of the individuals were infected with TB. Geographical variation in the prevalence of TB infection was observed. Those aged $>30$ years, being male, residing in urban location, and with past history of TB were more likely to have TB infection. Individuals with TB infection are reservoirs of future TB disease. Recent evidence from modelling study suggest the possibility of self-clearance of M.tb infection in $24.4\\%$ of individuals within 10 years of infection and $73.1\\%$ over a lifetime [28]. Further, the lifetime risk of TB in those retaining the viable infection is $17\\%$ . The self-clearance of M.tb infection was least in India compared to China and Japan [28]. The target of the END TB Strategy of the World Health Organisation (WHO), is to reduce the incidence of TB by $90\\%$ by 2035 while India is committed to elim­ inate TB by 2025 [1,3]. In the context of TB elimination in India, it is essential to map the population vulnerable to TB infection and provide primordial prevention by means of ACSM activities and improving the awareness on TB prevention. The National TB Elim­ ination Programme (NTEP) in India has been scaling up the im­ plementation of “Guidelines for Programmatic Management of Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment in India, $2021^{\\prime\\prime}$ by a compre­ hensive ‘cascade of care’ approach as a core strategy to deliver TPT services across the country [26]. This guideline is implemented across all the states to systematically reach out and screen all target populations (PLHIV, household contacts, and other groups at risk of developing TB disease) after ruling out TB and provide TPT as a part of the continuum of care. Scaling up of the comprehensive TB pre­ vention strategy is a critical component of the India’s National Strategic Plan 2017–25 and would hasten the decline of TB incidence in India. The testing for TB infection by indra-dermal skin test (CyTB) offers wider scope of its use under programmatic settings [29]. It is essential to also address determinants of TB disease which include malnutrition, social habits and co-morbid conditions. Targeted in­ terventions which include TB preventive therapy and active screening for early detection of disease in high-risk groups for TB is essential to reduce the burden of TB in India.  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nSS,RR,KR,-Conceptualisation, Funding acquisition, Data Collection and Site Coordination, Data analysis, Data Interpretation, reviewing, editing the draft and approval of the final draft, KT,RK- Data Management, Data analysis, Data Interpretation, Writing the first draft, editing and approval of the final draft BV, PC - Conceptualisation,Data analysis, Data Interpretation, Writing the first draft, editing and approval of the finaldraft SDB, AKB,JB,DC,VC,DD,KRD,GRD,AK,AL,MM,AM,SSM,CR,JT,PAM,MS,AR,AT, KS,NNK,NS,EI,CR-Data Collection and Site Coordination, RK,ACSoftware Design and Data Base Management, Data Collection and Site Coordination, KS,LEH-Lab co-ordination, Data Collection and Site Coordination, reviewing, editing the draft and approval of the final draft, MP, RRC, NK, RPJ, and PC – overall monitoring of the survey, data analysis and drafting the manuscript.
