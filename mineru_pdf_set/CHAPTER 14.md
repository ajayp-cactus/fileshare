Morrow  \n\nChest discomfort is among the most common reasons for which patients present for medical attention at either an emergency department (ED) or an outpatient clinic. The evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort is inherently challenging owing to the broad variety of possible causes, a minority of which are life-threatening conditions that should not be missed. It is helpful to frame the initial diagnostic assessment and triage of patients with acute chest discomfort around three categories: (1) myocardial ischemia; (2) other cardiopulmonary causes (myopericardial disease, aortic emergencies, and pulmonary conditions); and (3) noncardiopulmonary causes. Although rapid identification of high-risk conditions is a priority of the initial assessment, strategies that incorporate routine liberal use of testing carry the potential for adverse effects of unnecessary investigations.  \n\n# EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY  \n\nChest discomfort is one of the three most common reason for visits to the ED in the United States, resulting in 6 to 7 million emergency visits each year. More than $60\\%$ of patients with this presentation are hospitalized for further testing, and most of the remainder undergo additional investigation in the ED. Fewer than $15\\%$ of evaluated patients are eventually diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with rates of $10{-}20\\%$ in most series of unselected populations, and a rate as low as $5\\%$ in some studies. The most common diagnoses are gastrointestinal causes (Fig. 14-1), and as few as $5\\%$ are other life-threatening cardiopulmonary conditions. In a large proportion of patients with transient acute chest discomfort, ACS or another acute cardiopulmonary cause is excluded but the cause is not determined. Therefore, the resources and time devoted to the evaluation of chest discomfort in the absence of a severe cause are substantial. Nevertheless, historically, a disconcerting $2{-}6\\%$ of patients with chest discomfort of presumed nonischemic etiology who are discharged from the ED were later deemed to have had a missed myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with a missed diagnosis of MI have a 30-day risk of death that is double that of their counterparts who are hospitalized.  \n\nThe natural histories of ACS, myocarditis, acute pericardial diseases, pulmonary embolism, and aortic emergencies are discussed in Chaps. 270, 273, 274, 275, 279, and 280, respectively. In a study of more than 350,000 patients with unspecified presumed noncardiopulmonary chest discomfort, the mortality rate 1 year after discharge was $<2\\%$ and did not differ significantly from age-adjusted mortality in the general population. The estimated rate of major cardiovascular events through 30 days in patients with acute chest pain who had been stratified as low risk was $2.5\\%$ in a large population-based study that excluded patients with ST-segment elevation or definite noncardiac chest pain.  \n\n# CAUSES OF CHEST DISCOMFORT  \n\nThe major etiologies of chest discomfort are discussed in this section and summarized in Table 14-1. Additional elements of the history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing that aid in distinguishing these causes are discussed in a later section (see “Approach to the Patient”).  \n\n# ■MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA/INJURY  \n\nMyocardial ischemia causing chest discomfort, termed angina pectoris, is a primary clinical concern in patients presenting with chest symptoms. Myocardial ischemia is precipitated by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen requirements and myocardial oxygen supply, resulting in insufficient delivery of oxygen to meet the heart’s metabolic demands. Myocardial oxygen consumption may be elevated by increases in heart rate, ventricular wall stress, and myocardial contractility, whereas myocardial oxygen supply is determined by coronary blood flow and coronary arterial oxygen content. When myocardial ischemia is sufficiently severe and prolonged in duration (as little as $20\\mathrm{min},$ ), irreversible cellular injury occurs, resulting in MI.  \n\nIschemic heart disease is most commonly caused by atheromatous plaque that obstructs one or more of the epicardial coronary arteries. Stable ischemic heart disease (Chap. 273) usually results from the gradual atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary arteries. Stable angina is characterized by ischemic episodes that are typically precipitated by a superimposed increase in oxygen demand during physical exertion and relieved upon resting. Ischemic heart disease becomes unstable, manifest by ischemia at rest or with an escalating pattern, most commonly when rupture or erosion of one or more atherosclerotic lesions triggers coronary thrombosis. Unstable ischemic heart disease is further classified clinically by the presence or absence of detectable acute myocardial injury and the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation on the patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG). When acute coronary atherothrombosis occurs, the intracoronary thrombus may be partially obstructive, generally leading to myocardial ischemia in the absence of ST-segment elevation. Unstable ischemic heart disease is classified as unstable angina when there is no detectable acute myocardial injury and as non–ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) when there is evidence of acute myocardial necrosis (Chap. 274). When the coronary thrombus is acutely and completely occlusive, transmural myocardial ischemia usually ensues, with ST-segment elevation on the ECG and myocardial necrosis leading to a diagnosis of ST elevation MI (STEMI; see Chap. 275).  \n\n![](images/4ea780044e0da08361fd2ab4a53f96ce6cbb2daa9563b441155afeca6343b0a2.jpg)  \nFIGURE 14-1  Distribution of final discharge diagnoses in patients with nontraumatic acute chest pain. (Figure prepared from data in P Fruergaard et al: Eur Heart J 17:1028, 1996.)  \n\n![](images/68959714f31b58e3defd9e9d73956b70699a6c1e62c12bdc14df7ad78b2a6342.jpg)  \n\nClinicians should be aware that unstable ischemic symptoms may also occur predominantly because of increased myocardial oxygen demand (e.g., during intense psychological stress or fever) or because of decreased oxygen delivery due to anemia, hypoxia, or hypotension. However, the term acute coronary syndrome, which encompasses unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, is in general reserved for ischemia precipitated by acute coronary atherothrombosis. In order to guide therapeutic strategies, a standardized system for classification of MI has been expanded to discriminate MI resulting from acute coronary thrombosis (type 1 MI) from MI occurring secondary to other imbalances of myocardial oxygen supply and demand (type 2 MI; see Chap. 274). These conditions are additionally distinguished from nonischemic causes of acute myocardial injury, such as myocarditis.  \n\nOther contributors to stable and unstable ischemic heart disease, such as endothelial dysfunction, microvascular disease, and vasospasm, may exist alone or in combination with coronary atherosclerosis and may be the dominant cause of myocardial ischemia in some patients. Moreover, nonatherosclerotic processes, including congenital abnormalities of the coronary vessels, myocardial bridging, coronary arteritis, and radiation-induced coronary disease, can lead to coronary obstruction. In addition, conditions associated with extreme myocardial oxygen demand and impaired endocardial blood flow, such as aortic valve disease (Chap. 280), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (Chap. 259), can precipitate myocardial ischemia in patients with or without underlying obstructive atherosclerosis.  \n\nCharacteristics of Ischemic Chest Discomfort  The clinical characteristics of angina pectoris, often referred to simply as “angina,” are highly similar whether the ischemic discomfort is a manifestation of stable ischemic heart disease, unstable angina, or MI; the exceptions are differences in the pattern and duration of symptoms associated with these syndromes (Table 14-1). Heberden initially described angina as a sense of “strangling and anxiety.” Chest discomfort characteristic of myocardial ischemia is typically described as aching, heavy, squeezing, crushing, or constricting. However, in a substantial minority of patients, the quality of discomfort is extremely vague and may be described as a mild tightness, or merely an uncomfortable feeling, that sometimes is experienced as numbness or a burning sensation. The site of the discomfort is usually retrosternal, but radiation is common and generally occurs down the ulnar surface of the left arm; the right arm, both arms, neck, jaw, or shoulders may also be involved. These and other characteristics of ischemic chest discomfort pertinent to discrimination from other causes of chest pain are discussed later in this chapter (see “Approach to the Patient”).  \n\nStable angina usually begins gradually and reaches its maximal intensity over a period of minutes before dissipating within several minutes with rest or with nitroglycerin. The discomfort typically occurs predictably at a characteristic level of exertion or psychological stress. By definition, unstable angina is manifest by anginal chest discomfort that occurs with progressively lower intensity of physical activity or even at rest. Chest discomfort associated with MI is commonly more severe, is prolonged (usually lasting ${\\geq}30\\mathrm{min}$ ), and is not relieved by rest.  \n\nMechanisms of Cardiac Pain  The neural pathways involved in ischemic cardiac pain are poorly understood. Ischemic episodes are thought to excite local chemosensitive and mechanoreceptive receptors that, in turn, stimulate release of adenosine, bradykinin, and other substances that activate the sensory ends of sympathetic and vagal afferent fibers. The afferent fibers traverse the nerves that connect to the upper five thoracic sympathetic ganglia and upper five distal thoracic roots of the spinal cord. From there, impulses are transmitted to the thalamus. Within the spinal cord, cardiac sympathetic afferent impulses may converge with impulses from somatic thoracic structures, and this convergence may be the basis for referred cardiac pain. In addition, cardiac vagal afferent fibers synapse in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla and then descend to the upper cervical spinothalamic tract, and this route may contribute to anginal pain experienced in the neck and jaw.  \n\n# $\\sqsubset$ ■OTHER CARDIOPULMONARY CAUSES  \n\nPericardial and Other Myocardial Diseases (See also Chap. 270) Inflammation of the pericardium due to infectious or noninfectious causes can be responsible for acute or chronic chest discomfort. The visceral surface and most of the parietal surface of the pericardium are insensitive to pain. Therefore, the pain of pericarditis is thought to arise principally from associated pleural inflammation. Because of this pleural association, the discomfort of pericarditis is usually pleuritic pain that is exacerbated by breathing, coughing, or changes in position. Moreover, owing to the overlapping sensory supply of the central diaphragm via the phrenic nerve with somatic sensory fibers originating in the third to fifth cervical segments, the pain of pleural and pericardial inflammation is often referred to the shoulder and neck. Involvement of the pleural surface of the lateral diaphragm can lead to pain in the upper abdomen.  \n\nAcute inflammatory and other nonischemic myocardial diseases can also produce chest discomfort. The symptoms of acute myocarditis are highly varied. Chest discomfort may either originate with inflammatory injury of the myocardium or be due to severe increases in wall stress related to poor ventricular performance. The symptoms of Takotsubo (stress-related) cardiomyopathy often start abruptly with chest pain and shortness of breath. This form of cardiomyopathy, in its most recognizable form, is triggered by an emotionally or physically stressful event and may mimic acute MI because of its commonly associated ECG abnormalities, including ST-segment elevation, and elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury. Observational studies support a predilection for women ${>}50$ years of age.  \n\nDiseases of the Aorta (See also Chap. 280) Acute aortic dissection (Fig. 14-1) is a less common cause of chest discomfort but is important because of the catastrophic natural history of certain subsets of cases when recognized late or left untreated. Acute aortic syndromes encompass a spectrum of acute aortic diseases related to disruption of the media of the aortic wall. Aortic dissection involves a tear in the aortic intima, resulting in separation of the media and creation of a separate “false” lumen. A penetrating ulcer has been described as ulceration of an aortic atheromatous plaque that extends through the intima and into the aortic media, with the potential to initiate an intramedial dissection or rupture into the adventitia. Intramural hematoma is an aortic wall hematoma with no demonstrable intimal flap, no radiologically apparent intimal tear, and no false lumen. Intramural hematoma can occur due to either rupture of the vasa vasorum or, less commonly, a penetrating ulcer.  \n\nEach of these subtypes of acute aortic syndrome typically presents with chest discomfort that is often severe, sudden in onset, and sometimes described as “tearing” in quality. Acute aortic syndromes involving the ascending aorta tend to cause pain in the midline of the anterior chest, whereas descending aortic syndromes most often present with pain in the back. Therefore, dissections that begin in the ascending aorta and extend to the descending aorta tend to cause pain in the front of the chest that extends toward the back, between the shoulder blades. Proximal aortic dissections that involve the ascending aorta (type A in the Stanford nomenclature) are at high risk for major complications that may influence the clinical presentation, including (1) compromise of the aortic ostia of the coronary arteries, resulting in MI; (2) disruption of the aortic valve, causing acute aortic insufficiency; and (3) rupture of the hematoma into the pericardial space, leading to pericardial tamponade.  \n\nKnowledge of the epidemiology of acute aortic syndromes can be helpful in maintaining awareness of this relatively uncommon group of disorders (estimated annual incidence, 3 cases per 100,000 population). Nontraumatic aortic dissections are very rare in the absence of hypertension or conditions associated with deterioration of the elastic or muscular components of the aortic media, including pregnancy, bicuspid aortic disease, or inherited connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.  \n\nAlthough aortic aneurysms are most often asymptomatic, thoracic aortic aneurysms can cause chest pain and other symptoms by compressing adjacent structures. This pain tends to be steady, deep, and occasionally severe. Aortitis, whether of noninfectious or infectious etiology, in the absence of aortic dissection is a rare cause of chest or back discomfort.  \n\nPulmonary Conditions  Pulmonary and pulmonary-vascular conditions that cause chest discomfort usually do so in conjunction with dyspnea and often produce symptoms that have a pleuritic nature.  \n\nPULMONARY EMBOLISM (SEE ALSO CHAP. 279)  Pulmonary emboli (annual incidence, ${\\sim}1$ per 1000) can produce dyspnea and chest discomfort that is sudden in onset. Typically pleuritic in pattern, the chest discomfort associated with pulmonary embolism may result from (1) involvement of the pleural surface of the lung adjacent to a resultant pulmonary infarction; (2) distention of the pulmonary artery; or (3) possibly, right ventricular wall stress and/or subendocardial ischemia related to acute pulmonary hypertension. The pain associated with small pulmonary emboli is often lateral and pleuritic and is believed to be related to the first of these three possible mechanisms. In contrast, massive pulmonary emboli may cause severe substernal pain that may mimic an MI and that is plausibly attributed to the second and third of these potential mechanisms. Massive or submassive pulmonary embolism may also be associated with syncope, hypotension, and signs of right heart failure. Other typical characteristics that aid in the recognition of pulmonary embolism are discussed later in this chapter (see “Approach to the Patient”).  \n\nPNEUMOTHORAX (SEE ALSO CHAP. 294)  Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare cause of chest discomfort, with an estimated annual incidence in the United States of 7 per 100,000 among men and ${<}2$ per 100,000 among women. Risk factors include male sex, smoking, family history, and Marfan syndrome. The symptoms are usually sudden in onset, and dyspnea may be mild; thus, presentation to medical attention is sometimes delayed. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in patients with underlying lung disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or cystic fibrosis, and usually produces symptoms that are more severe. Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency caused by trapped intrathoracic air that precipitates hemodynamic collapse.  \n\nOther Pulmonary Parenchymal, Pleural, or Vascular Disease (See also Chaps. 283, 284, and 294) Most pulmonary diseases that produce chest pain, including pneumonia and malignancy, do so because of involvement of the pleura or surrounding structures. Pleurisy is typically described as a knifelike pain that is worsened by inspiration or coughing. In contrast, chronic pulmonary hypertension can manifest as chest pain that may be very similar to angina in its characteristics, suggesting right ventricular myocardial ischemia in some cases. Reactive airways diseases similarly can cause chest tightness associated with breathlessness rather than pleurisy.  \n\n# ■NONCARDIOPULMONARY CAUSES  \n\nGastrointestinal Conditions (See also Chap. 321) Gastrointestinal disorders are the most common cause of nontraumatic chest discomfort and often produce symptoms that are difficult to discern from more serious causes of chest pain, including myocardial ischemia. Esophageal disorders, in particular, may simulate angina in the character and location of the pain. Gastroesophageal reflux and disorders of esophageal motility are common and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain (Fig. 14-1 and Table 14-1). The pain of esophageal spasm is commonly an intense, squeezing discomfort that is retrosternal in location and, like angina, may be relieved by nitroglycerin or dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. Chest pain can also result from injury to the esophagus, such as a Mallory-Weiss tear or even an esophageal rupture (Boerhaave’s syndrome) caused by severe vomiting. Peptic ulcer disease is most commonly epigastric in location but can radiate into the chest (Table 14-1).  \n\nHepatobiliary disorders, including cholecystitis and biliary colic, may mimic acute cardiopulmonary diseases. Although the pain arising from these disorders usually localizes to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, it is variable and may be felt in the epigastrium and radiate to the back and lower chest. This discomfort is sometimes referred to the scapula or may in rare cases be felt in the shoulder, suggesting diaphragmatic irritation. The pain is steady, usually lasts several hours, and subsides spontaneously, without symptoms between attacks. Pain resulting from pancreatitis is typically aching epigastric pain that radiates to the back.  \n\nMusculoskeletal and Other Causes (See also Chap. 360) Chest discomfort can be produced by any musculoskeletal disorder involving the chest wall or the nerves of the chest wall, neck, or upper limbs. Costochondritis causing tenderness of the costochondral junctions (Tietze’s syndrome) is relatively common. Cervical radiculitis may manifest as a prolonged or constant aching discomfort in the upper chest and limbs. The pain may be exacerbated by motion of the neck. Occasionally, chest pain can be caused by compression of the brachial plexus by the cervical ribs, and tendinitis or bursitis involving the left shoulder may mimic the radiation of angina. Pain in a dermatomal distribution can also be caused by cramping of intercostal muscles or by herpes zoster (Chap. 193).  \n\nEmotional and Psychiatric Conditions  As many as $10\\%$ of patients who present to EDs with acute chest discomfort have a panic disorder or related condition (Table 14-1). The symptoms may include chest tightness or aching that is associated with a sense of anxiety and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may be prolonged or fleeting.  \n\n# Chest Discomfort  \n\nGiven the broad set of potential causes and the heterogeneous risk of serious complications in patients who present with acute nontraumatic chest discomfort, the priorities of the initial clinical encounter include assessment of (1) the patient’s clinical stability and (2) the probability that the patient has an underlying cause of the discomfort that may be life-threatening. The high-risk conditions of principal concern are acute cardiopulmonary processes, including ACS, acute aortic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and pericarditis with tamponade. Fulminant myocarditis also carries a poor prognosis but is usually also manifest by heart failure symptoms. Among noncardiopulmonary causes of chest pain, esophageal rupture likely holds the greatest urgency for diagnosis. Patients with these conditions may deteriorate rapidly despite initially appearing well. The remaining population with noncardiopulmonary conditions has a more favorable prognosis during completion of the diagnostic workup. A rapid targeted assessment for a serious cardiopulmonary cause is of particular relevance for patients with acute ongoing pain who have presented for emergency evaluation. Among patients presenting in the outpatient setting with chronic pain or pain that has resolved, a general diagnostic assessment is reasonably undertaken (see “Outpatient Evaluation of Chest Discomfort,” below). A series of questions that can be used to structure the clinical evaluation of patients with chest discomfort is shown in Table 14-2.  \n\n# HISTORY  \n\nThe evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort relies heavily on the clinical history and physical examination to direct subsequent diagnostic testing. The evaluating clinician should assess the quality, location (including radiation), and pattern (including onset and duration) of the pain as well as any provoking or alleviating factors. The presence of associated symptoms may also be useful in establishing a diagnosis.  \n\nQuality of Pain  The quality of chest discomfort alone is never sufficient to establish a diagnosis. However, the characteristics of the pain are pivotal in formulating an initial clinical impression and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process (Table 14-1), including ACS in particular (Fig. 14-2). Pressure or tightness is consistent with a typical presentation of myocardial ischemic pain. Nevertheless, the clinician must remember that some patients with ischemic chest symptoms deny any “pain” but rather complain of dyspnea or a vague sense of anxiety. The severity of the discomfort has poor diagnostic accuracy. It is often helpful to ask about the similarity of the discomfort to previous definite ischemic symptoms. It is unusual for angina to be sharp, as in knifelike, stabbing, or pleuritic; however, patients sometimes use the word “sharp” to convey the intensity of discomfort rather than the quality. Pleuritic discomfort is suggestive of a process involving the pleura, including pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary parenchymal processes. Less frequently, the pain of pericarditis or massive pulmonary embolism is a steady severe pressure or aching that can be difficult to discriminate from myocardial ischemia. “Tearing” or “ripping” pain is often described by patients with acute aortic dissection. However, acute aortic emergencies also present commonly with knifelike pain. A burning quality can suggest acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease but may also occur with myocardial ischemia. Esophageal pain, particularly with spasm, can be a severe squeezing discomfort identical to angina.  \n\n![](images/63bb0e5f1d50bf91e882641c486bf3d1abc57b021f9f0ce668c3208db37900ef.jpg)  \nSource: Developed by Dr. Thomas H. Lee for the 18th edition of Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.  \n\n![](images/605a875c5c9980ad18994db70dd643d6a6daa6c406103679ade32c54c33b4cb5.jpg)  \nFIGURE 14-2  Association of chest pain characteristics with the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Note that a subsequent larger study showed a nonsignificant association with radiation to the right arm. (Figure prepared from data in $\\complement J$ Swap, JT Nagurney: JAMA 294:2623, 2005.)  \n\nLocation of Discomfort  A substernal location with radiation to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arms is typical of myocardial ischemic discomfort. Radiation to both arms has a particularly high association with MI as the etiology. Some patients present with aching in sites of radiated pain as their only symptoms of ischemia. However, pain that is highly localized—e.g., that which can be demarcated by the tip of one finger—is highly unusual for angina. A retrosternal location should prompt consideration of esophageal pain; however, other gastrointestinal conditions usually present with pain that is most intense in the abdomen or epigastrium, with possible radiation into the chest. Angina may also occur in an epigastric location. Pain that occurs solely above the mandible or below the epigastrium is rarely angina. Severe pain radiating to the back, particularly between the shoulder blades, should prompt consideration of an acute aortic syndrome. Radiation to the trapezius ridge is characteristic of pericardial pain and does not usually occur with angina.  \n\nPattern  Myocardial ischemic discomfort usually builds over minutes and is exacerbated by activity and mitigated by rest. In contrast, pain that reaches its peak intensity immediately is more suggestive of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or spontaneous pneumothorax. Pain that is fleeting (lasting only a few seconds) is rarely ischemic in origin. Similarly, pain that is constant in intensity for a prolonged period (many hours to days) is unlikely to represent myocardial ischemia if it occurs in the absence of other clinical consequences, such as abnormalities of the ECG, elevation of cardiac biomarkers, or clinical sequelae (e.g., heart failure or hypotension). Both myocardial ischemia and acid reflux may have their onset in the morning.  \n\nProvoking and Alleviating Factors  Patients with myocardial ischemic pain usually prefer to rest, sit, or stop walking. However, clinicians should be aware of the phenomenon of “warm-up angina” in which some patients experience relief of angina as they continue at the same or even a greater level of exertion (Chap. 273). Alterations in the intensity of pain with changes in position or movement of the upper extremities and neck are less likely with myocardial ischemia and suggest a musculoskeletal etiology. The pain of pericarditis, however, often is worse in the supine position and relieved by sitting upright and leaning forward. Gastroesophageal reflux may be exacerbated by alcohol, some foods, or a reclined position. Relief can occur with sitting.  \n\nExacerbation by eating suggests a gastrointestinal etiology such as peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis. Peptic ulcer disease tends to become symptomatic $60{-}90~\\mathrm{min}$ after meals. However, in the setting of severe coronary atherosclerosis, redistribution of blood flow to the splanchnic vasculature after eating can trigger postprandial angina. The discomfort of acid reflux and peptic ulcer disease is usually diminished promptly by acid-reducing therapies. In contrast with its impact in some patients with angina, physical exertion is very unlikely to alter symptoms from gastrointestinal causes of chest pain. Relief of chest discomfort within minutes after administration of nitroglycerin is suggestive of but not sufficiently sensitive or specific for a definitive diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Esophageal spasm may also be relieved promptly with nitroglycerin. A delay of ${>}10~\\mathrm{min}$ before relief is obtained after nitroglycerin suggests that the symptoms either are not caused by ischemia or are caused by severe ischemia, such as during acute MI.  \n\nAssociated Symptoms  Symptoms that accompany myocardial ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faintness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress should lead to consideration of pulmonary embolism and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure but usually points toward a pulmonary parenchymal etiology of chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or presyncope should prompt consideration of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection as well as ischemic arrhythmias. Although nausea and vomiting suggest a gastrointestinal disorder, these symptoms may occur in the setting of MI (more commonly inferior MI), presumably because of activation of the vagal reflex or stimulation of left ventricular receptors as part of the BezoldJarisch reflex.  \n\nPast Medical History  The past medical history is useful in assessing the patient for risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolism (Chap. 279) as well as for conditions that may predispose the patient to specific disorders. For example, a history of connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome should heighten the clinician’s suspicion of an acute aortic syndrome or spontaneous pneumothorax. A careful history may elicit clues about depression or prior panic attacks.  \n\n# PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \n\nIn addition to providing an initial assessment of the patient’s clinical stability, the physical examination of patients with chest discomfort can provide direct evidence of specific etiologies of chest pain (e.g., unilateral absence of lung sounds) and can identify potential precipitants of acute cardiopulmonary causes of chest pain (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension), relevant comorbid conditions (e.g., obstructive pulmonary disease), and complications of the presenting syndrome (e.g., heart failure). However, because the findings on physical examination may be normal in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease, an unremarkable physical exam is not definitively reassuring.  \n\nGeneral  The patient’s general appearance is helpful in establishing an initial impression of the severity of illness. Patients with acute MI or other acute cardiopulmonary disorders often appear anxious, uncomfortable, pale, cyanotic, or diaphoretic. Patients who are massaging or clutching their chests may describe their pain with a clenched fist held against the sternum (Levine’s sign). Occasionally, body habitus is helpful—e.g., in patients with Marfan syndrome or the prototypical young, tall, thin man with spontaneous pneumothorax.  \n\nVital Signs  Significant tachycardia and hypotension are indicative of important hemodynamic consequences of the underlying cause of chest discomfort and should prompt a rapid survey for the most severe conditions, such as acute MI with cardiogenic shock, massive pulmonary embolism, pericarditis with tamponade, or tension pneumothorax. Acute aortic emergencies usually present with severe hypertension but may be associated with profound hypotension when there is coronary arterial compromise or dissection into the pericardium. Sinus tachycardia is an important manifestation of submassive pulmonary embolism. Tachypnea and hypoxemia point toward a pulmonary cause. The presence of low-grade fever is nonspecific because it may occur with MI and with thromboembolism in addition to infection.  \n\nPulmonary Examination of the lungs may localize a primary pulmonary cause of chest discomfort, as in cases of pneumonia, asthma, or pneumothorax. Left ventricular dysfunction from severe ischemia/infarction as well as acute valvular complications of MI or aortic dissection can lead to pulmonary edema, which is an indicator of high risk.  \n\nCardiac  The jugular venous pulse is often normal in patients with acute myocardial ischemia but may reveal characteristic patterns with pericardial tamponade or acute right ventricular dysfunction (Chaps. 239 and 270). Cardiac auscultation may reveal a third or, more commonly, a fourth heart sound, reflecting myocardial systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Murmurs of mitral regurgitation or a ventricular-septal defect may indicate mechanical complications of STEMI. A murmur of aortic insufficiency may be a complication of ascending aortic dissection. Other murmurs may reveal underlying cardiac disorders contributory to ischemia (e.g., aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Pericardial friction rubs reflect pericardial inflammation.  \n\nAbdominal  Localizing tenderness on the abdominal exam is useful in identifying a gastrointestinal cause of the presenting syndrome. Abdominal findings are infrequent with purely acute cardiopulmonary problems, except in the case of right-sided heart failure leading to hepatic congestion.  \n\nExtremities  Vascular pulse deficits may reflect underlying chronic atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery disease. However, evidence of acute limb ischemia with loss of the pulse and pallor, particularly in the upper extremities, can indicate catastrophic consequences of aortic dissection. Unilateral lower-extremity swelling should raise suspicion about venous thromboembolism.  \n\nMusculoskeletal  Pain arising from the costochondral and chondrosternal articulations may be associated with localized swelling, redness, or marked localized tenderness. Pain on palpation of these joints is usually well localized and is a useful clinical sign, although deep palpation may elicit pain in the absence of costochondritis. Although palpation of the chest wall often elicits pain in patients with various musculoskeletal conditions, it should be appreciated that chest wall tenderness does not exclude myocardial ischemia. Sensory deficits in the upper extremities may be indicative of cervical disk disease.  \n\n# ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY  \n\nElectrocardiography is crucial in the evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort. The ECG is pivotal for identifying patients with ongoing ischemia as the principal reason for their presentation as well as secondary cardiac complications of other disorders. Professional society guidelines recommend that an ECG be obtained within $10\\mathrm{min}$ of presentation, with the primary goal of identifying patients with ST-segment elevation diagnostic of MI who are candidates for immediate interventions to restore flow in the occluded coronary artery. ST-segment depression and symmetric T-wave inversions at least $0.2\\mathrm{mV}$ in depth are useful for detecting myocardial ischemia in the absence of STEMI and are also indicative of higher risk of death or recurrent ischemia. Serial performance of ECGs (every $30{-}60\\mathrm{min})$ is recommended in the ED evaluation of suspected ACS. In addition, an ECG with right-sided lead placement should be considered in patients with clinically suspected ischemia and a nondiagnostic standard 12-lead ECG. Despite the value of the resting ECG, its sensitivity for ischemia is poor—as low as $20\\%$ in some studies.  \n\nAbnormalities of the ST segment and $\\mathrm{T}$ wave may occur in a variety of conditions, including pulmonary embolism, ventricular hypertrophy, acute and chronic pericarditis, myocarditis, electrolyte imbalance, and metabolic disorders. Notably, hyperventilation associated with panic disorder can also lead to nonspecific ST and T-wave abnormalities. Pulmonary embolism is most often associated with sinus tachycardia but can also lead to rightward shift of the ECG axis, manifesting as an S-wave in lead I, with a Q-wave and T-wave in lead III (Chaps. 240 and 279). In patients with ST-segment elevation, the presence of diffuse lead involvement not corresponding to a specific coronary anatomic distribution and PR-segment depression can aid in distinguishing pericarditis from acute MI.  \n\n# CHEST RADIOGRAPHY  \n\n(See Chap. A12) Plain radiography of the chest is performed routinely when patients present with acute chest discomfort and selectively when individuals who are being evaluated as outpatients have subacute or chronic pain. The chest radiograph is most useful for identifying pulmonary processes, such as pneumonia or pneumothorax. Findings are often unremarkable in patients with ACS, but pulmonary edema may be evident. Other specific findings include widening of the mediastinum in some patients with aortic dissection, Hampton’s hump or Westermark’s sign in patients with pulmonary embolism (Chaps. 279 and A12), or pericardial calcification in chronic pericarditis.  \n\n# CARDIAC BIOMARKERS  \n\nLaboratory testing in patients with acute chest pain is focused on the detection of myocardial injury. Such injury can be detected by the presence of circulating proteins released from damaged cardiomyocytes. Owing to the time necessary for this release, initial biomarkers of injury may be in the normal range, even in patients with STEMI. Cardiac troponin is the preferred biomarker for the diagnosis of MI and should be measured in all patients with suspected ACS. It is not necessary or advisable to measure troponin in patients without suspicion of ACS unless this test is being used specifically for risk stratification (e.g., in pulmonary embolism or heart failure).  \n\nThe development of cardiac troponin assays with progressively greater analytical sensitivity has facilitated detection of substantially lower blood concentrations of troponin than was previously possible. This evolution permits earlier detection of myocardial injury and more reliable discrimination of changing values, enhances the overall accuracy of a diagnosis of MI, and improves risk stratification in suspected ACS. For these reasons, high-sensitivity assays are generally preferred over prior generation troponin assays. The greater negative predictive value of a negative troponin result with high-sensitivity assays is an advantage in the evaluation of chest pain in the ED. Rapid rule-out protocols that use serial testing and changes in troponin concentration over as short a period as $^{1-2\\textrm{h}}$ appear to perform well for diagnosis of ACS when using a high-sensitivity tro ponin assay. Troponin should be measured at presentation and repeated at $\\mathrm{l}{-3\\mathrm{h}}$ using high-sensitivity troponin and $_{3-6\\mathrm{~h~}}$ using conventional troponin assays. Additional troponin measurements may be warranted beyond $3{-}6\\mathrm{~h~}$ when the clinical condition still suggests possible ACS or if there is diagnostic uncertainty. In patients presenting more than $^{2-3\\mathrm{h}}$ after symptom onset, a concentration of cardiac troponin, at the time of hospital presentation, below the limit of detection using a high-sensitivity assay may be sufficient to exclude MI with a negative predictive value ${>}99\\%$ .  \n\nWith the use of high-sensitivity assays for troponin, myocardial injury is detected in a larger proportion of patients who have nonACS cardiopulmonary conditions than with previous, less sensitive assays. Therefore, other aspects of the clinical evaluation are critical to the practitioner’s determination of the probability that the symptoms represent ACS. In addition, observation of a change in cardiac troponin concentration between serial samples is necessary for discriminating acute causes of myocardial injury from chronic elevation due to underlying structural heart disease, end-stage renal disease, or the rare presence of interfering antibodies. The diagnosis of MI is reserved for acute myocardial injury that is marked by a rising and/or falling pattern—with at least one value exceeding the 99th percentile reference limit—and that is caused by ischemia. Other nonischemic insults, such as myocarditis, may result in acute myocardial injury but should not be labeled MI (Fig. 14-3).  \n\n![](images/f9a7065a09537d603a336411938657241f29e995a8a92589029665e278012f3f.jpg)  \nFIGURE 14-3  Clinical classification of patients with elevated cardiac troponin (cTn). MI, myocardial infarction.  \n\nOther laboratory assessments may include the D-dimer test to aid in exclusion of pulmonary embolism (Chap. 279). Measurement of a B-type natriuretic peptide is useful when considered in conjunction with the clinical history and exam for the diagnosis of heart failure. B-type natriuretic peptides also provide prognostic information among patients with ACS and those with pulmonary embolism.  \n\n# INTEGRATIVE DECISION-AIDS  \n\nMultiple clinical algorithms have been developed to aid in decisionmaking during the evaluation and disposition of patients with acute nontraumatic chest pain. Such decision-aids estimate either of two closely related but not identical probabilities: (1) the probability of a final diagnosis of ACS and (2) the probability of major cardiac events during short-term follow-up. Such decision-aids are used most commonly to identify patients with a low clinical probability of ACS who are candidates for discharge from the ED, with or without additional noninvasive testing. Goldman and Lee developed one of the first such decision-aids, using only the ECG and risk indicators—hypotension, pulmonary rales, and known ischemic heart disease—to categorize patients into four risk categories ranging from a ${<}1\\%$ to a $>16\\%$ probability of a major cardiovascular complication. Decision-aids used more commonly in current practice are shown in Fig. 14-4. Elements common across multiple risk stratification tools are (1) symptoms typical for ACS; (2) older age; (3) risk factors for or known atherosclerosis; (4) ischemic ECG abnormalities; and (5) elevated cardiac troponin level. Although, because of very low specificity, the overall diagnostic performance of such decision-aids is poor (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.55–0.65), in conjunction with the ECG and serial highsensitivity cardiac troponin, they can help identify patients with a very low probability of ACS (e.g., $<1\\%$ ) or adverse cardiovascular events $<2\\%$ at 30 days). Clinical application of such integrated decision-aids or “accelerated diagnostic protocols” has been reported to achieve overall “miss rates” for ACS of ${<}0.5\\%$ and may be useful for identifying patients who may be discharged without the need for additional cardiac testing.  \n\nClinicians should differentiate between the algorithms discussed above and risk scores derived for stratification of prognosis (e.g., the TIMI and GRACE risk scores, Chap. 275) in patients who already have an established diagnosis of ACS. The latter risk scores were not designed to be used for diagnostic assessment.  \n\n# CORONARY AND MYOCARDIAL STRESS IMAGING  \n\nAmong patients for whom other life-threatening causes of chest pain have been reasonably excluded and serial biomarker and clinical assessment have determined the patient to remain eligible for further testing because of intermediate or undetermined risk, diagnostic coronary imaging with coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography or functional testing, preferably with nuclear or echocardiographic imaging, is recommended. Patient characteristics (e.g., body habitus and renal function), prior cardiac testing,  \n\n![](images/aa58d5f51ce8f094cf2d21fbe6ea7904268adf7e95556831814857dc6ad9aeaf.jpg)  \n\n![](images/f72304f01d696857a873e30f89bf36e307f27b421b03eda374609d5ecf202520.jpg)  \n\n# AND cardiac troponin < the limit of quantification.  \n\n![](images/6f253abc0092c514801447b3bcb73023a438c24447184d13dde96494e4a28545.jpg)  \nFIGURE 14-4  Examples of decision-aids used in conjunction with serial measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) for evaluation of acute chest pain.

CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; CAD, coronary artery disease; ECG, electrocardiogram; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention. (Figure prepared from data in DG Mark et al: J Am Coll Cardiol 13:606, 2018.)  \n\nhistory of known coronary artery disease, existing contraindications for a given test modality, and patient preferences are considerations when choosing among these diagnostic tests (Chaps. 241 and A9).  \n\nCT Angiography (See Chap. 241)  CT angiography has emerged as a preferred modality for the evaluation of patients with acute chest discomfort who are candidates for further testing after biomarker and clinical risk assessment. Coronary CT angiography is a sensitive technique for detection of obstructive coronary disease. CT appears to enhance the speed to disposition of patients with a low-intermediate probability for ACS, with its major strength being the negative predictive value of a finding of no significant stenosis or coronary plaque. In addition, contrast-enhanced CT can detect focal areas of myocardial injury in the acute setting. At the same time, CT angiography can exclude aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary embolism.  \n\nStress Nuclear Perfusion Imaging or Stress Echocardiography (See Chaps. 241 and A9)  Functional testing with stress nuclear perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography are alternatives for the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain who are candidates for further testing and are preferred over coronary CT angiography in patients with known obstructive epicardial disease. The selection of stress test modality may depend on institutional availability and expertise. Stress testing with myocardial imaging, either with nuclear perfusion imaging or echocardiography, offers superior diagnostic performance over exercise ECG. In patients selected for stress myocardial imaging who are able to exercise, exercise stress is preferred over pharmacologic testing. When available, positron emission tomography offers advantages of improved diagnostic performance and fewer nondiagnostic studies than single-photon emission CT.  \n\nAlthough functional testing is generally contraindicated in patients with ongoing chest pain, in selected patients with persistent pain and nondiagnostic ECG and biomarker data, resting myocardial perfusion images can be obtained; the absence of any perfusion abnormality substantially reduces the likelihood of coronary artery disease. In such a strategy, used in some centers, those with abnormal rest perfusion imaging, which cannot discriminate between old or new myocardial defects, usually must undergo additional evaluation.  \n\n# EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY  \n\nExercise electrocardiography has historically been commonly employed for completion of risk stratification of patients who have undergone an initial evaluation that has not revealed a specific cause of chest discomfort and has identified a low risk of ACS. Early exercise testing is safe in patients without ongoing chest pain or high-risk findings and may assist in refining their prognostic assessment. However, for patients with chest pain for whom both cardiac troponin and clinical risk stratification have determined the patient to have low probability of ACS, there is insufficient evidence that stress testing or cardiac imaging improves their outcomes. This evolution in evidence supports a change from past practice in which outpatient stress testing within 72 hours was broadly used for patients with acute chest pain.  \n\n# OTHER NONINVASIVE STUDIES  \n\nOther noninvasive imaging studies of the chest can be used selectively to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information on patients with chest discomfort.  \n\nEchocardiography  Echocardiography (nonstress) is not necessarily routine in patients with chest discomfort. However, in patients with an uncertain diagnosis, particularly those with nondiagnostic ST elevation, ongoing symptoms, or hemodynamic instability, detection of abnormal regional wall motion provides evidence of possible ischemic dysfunction. Echocardiography is diagnostic in patients with mechanical complications of MI or in patients with pericardial tamponade. Transthoracic echocardiography is poorly sensitive for aortic dissection, although an intimal flap may sometimes be detected in the ascending aorta.  \n\nMRI (See Chap. 241)  Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an evolving, versatile technique for structural and functional evaluation of the heart and the vasculature of the chest. CMR can be performed as a modality for pharmacologic stress perfusion imaging. Gadolinium-enhanced CMR can provide early detection of MI, defining areas of myocardial necrosis accurately, and can delineate patterns of myocardial disease that are often useful in discriminating ischemic from nonischemic myocardial injury. Although usually not practical for the urgent evaluation of acute chest discomfort, CMR can be a useful modality for cardiac structural evaluation of patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels in the absence of definite coronary artery disease. CMR coronary angiography is in its early stages. MRI also permits highly accurate assessment for aortic dissection but is infrequently used as the first test because CT and transesophageal echocardiography are usually more practical.  \n\n# ■■CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR ACUTE CHEST DISCOMFORT  \n\nBecause of the challenges inherent in reliably identifying the small proportion of patients with serious causes of acute chest discomfort while not exposing the larger number of low-risk patients to unnecessary testing and extended ED or hospital evaluations, many medical centers have adopted critical pathways to expedite the assessment and management of patients with nontraumatic chest pain, often in dedicated chest pain units. Such pathways are generally aimed at (1) rapid identification, triage, and treatment of high-risk cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., STEMI); (2) accurate identification of low-risk patients who can be safely observed in units with less intensive monitoring, undergo early noninvasive testing, or be discharged home; and (3) through more efficient and systematic accelerated diagnostic protocols, safe reduction in costs associated with overuse of testing and unnecessary hospitalizations. In some studies, provision of protocol-driven care in chest pain units has decreased costs and overall duration of hospital evaluation with no detectable excess of adverse clinical outcomes.  \n\n# ■■OUTPATIENT EVALUATION OF CHEST DISCOMFORT  \n\nChest pain is common in outpatient practice, with a lifetime prevalence of $20-40\\%$ in the general population. More than $25\\%$ of patients with MI have had a related visit with a primary care physician in the previous month. The diagnostic principles are the same as in the ED. However, the pretest probability of an acute cardiopulmonary cause is significantly lower. Therefore, testing paradigms are less intense, with an emphasis on the history, physical examination, and ECG. Moreover, decision-aids developed for settings with a high prevalence of significant cardiopulmonary disease have lower positive predictive value when applied in the practitioner’s office. However, in general, if the level of clinical suspicion of ACS is sufficiently high to consider troponin testing, the patient should be referred to the ED for evaluation.  \n\n# $\\sqsubset$ ■FURTHER READING  \n\nAmsterdam EA et al: Testing of low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association.

Jacobs  \n\nCorrectly diagnosing acute abdominal pain can be quite challenging. Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 15-1).  \n\nThe etiologic classification in Table 15-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain.  \n\nAny patient with abdominal pain of recent onset requires an early and thorough evaluation. The most common causes of abdominal pain on admission are nonspecific abdominal pain, acute appendicitis, pain of urologic origin, and intestinal obstruction. A diagnosis of “acute or surgical abdomen” is not acceptable because of its often misleading and erroneous connotations. Most patients who present with acute abdominal pain will have self-limited disease processes. However, it is important to remember that pain severity does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the underlying condition. And, the presence or absence of various degrees of “hunger” is unreliable as a sole indicator of the severity of intraabdominal disease. The most obvious of “acute abdomens” may not require operative intervention, and the mildest of abdominal pains may herald an urgently correctable disease.  \n\n# ■SOME MECHANISMS OF PAIN ORIGINATING IN THE ABDOMEN  \n\nInflammation of the Parietal Peritoneum  The pain of parietal peritoneal inflammation is steady and aching in character and is located directly over the inflamed area, its exact reference being possible because it is transmitted by somatic nerves supplying the parietal peritoneum. The intensity of the pain is dependent on the type and amount of material to which the peritoneal surfaces are exposed in a given time period. For example, the sudden release of a small quantity  \n\n# TABLE 15-1  Some Key Components of the Patient’s History  \n\n![](images/5edea48d1a1850a535cc8a3eac99ea796f786b84013831b9b513850a92cd8200.jpg)  "}
