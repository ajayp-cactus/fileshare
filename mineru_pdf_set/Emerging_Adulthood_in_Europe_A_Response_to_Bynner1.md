andendorses thetheory toa large extent.Bynner agreeswithmyargument that social,economic,and demographic changes over the past half-century have resultedin dramaticchanges inwhat occurs during the lateteens andearly-to-midtwentiesformostpeopleinindustrialized countries.Becausemostpeoplenowfinish theirdcationbtainstablemoymentmarryandhavethirfistchildmucha than inthepast,itnolongermakes

thechanges that led to this division by nresenting data on threeBritish cohorts,born in1946,1958,and1970.  \n\nThusBynner andIagree on themost important issues,namelyunepioiouuu nature of the changes in youngpeople'slives over thepast half-centuryand the usefulnessof the theory of emerging adulthood as a framework for describing, analyzing,and nvestigatingthosechanges.Myfocusinthispaperwill

scholars.  \n\n# EmergingAdulthood inEurope:An Overview  \n\nIn thepasthalf-century,a demographicshifthastakenplaceacrossindustrialzea conntrieswith remarkable consistency.In every country,themedian age at first marriage hasrisen steeply from the early twenties into the late twenties,even surpassingage30innorthernEurope.Youngpeoplehavewaited longerformarriage but notnecessarily for sex:premarital sex has become widespread,and sexual initiationandmarriageareno longer closely linked.Participation in higher education has become more widespread,and young women now surpass young men in participationinandgraduationfromuniversity.Thebirthratehasfallen,aswomen have theirfirstchild later,oftenhavejustone,andmoreoftenthaninthepasthave none at all.It is this set of interconnected demographic changes,and the psychologicalphenomena accompanying them,thathasled an increasingnumber ofscholars to concludethat thereisnowa new stage of thelifecourse,emerging adulthood,between adolescence and youngadulthood (for example,Cohen et al. 2003;Eccles etal.2003;Nelsonet al.2004;Arnett&Tanner2006)  \n\nBynner describes some ofthese changes as they have takenplacein successive cohorts in Great Britain.However,the most recent British cohort he includes was bornin1970,andmostof thedatahepresentedfrom therestofEuropewerefrom thelate1980s (published in 1990).A great deal of change has occurred in the past two decades.Forillustration,TableIpresents themostrecent data with respect to the median marriage agein avariety of European countries.Withrespect to Britain specifically,themedianmarriageagehasrisenby over5yearssince1980.  \n\nSimilarchangeshave takenplace inother countries.EasternEuropean countries havemedianmarriagesthat arelowerthaninWesternEuropebut areclearlyheading up.The median marriage age in theUSA,presented in Table 1for comparison,is actuallysubstantiallylowerthaninotherWesternEuropeancountries.  \n\nOf course,itisnotonly thedemographicchanges that areimportant.The risein themedianmarriage ageisemblematicof theprofound changein howyoungpeople  \n\nTable1Medianmarriageages（years）in selectedEuropeancountries,1980and2000

in this age period feel likeneither adolescentsnor（fully)adults,but somewhere inbetween.IntheUSA,in numerousstudies,Ihavefoundthatwhen askedwhethertheyfeel theyhavereached adulthood,most people in the18-25agerangerespondneitheryesnornobutin somewaysyes,insomewaysno（Anett1997,1998,2001,2003a,2004）.Astudyin TheNetherlandsreported similarresults(Pluget al.2003)acrosssocial classes,andI havefound thesameresultsinDenmark(Arnett 2003b).  \n\nFurtherinsightson emerging adulthood inEurope come fromrecent ethnographic work by Carrie Douglass (2005) and colleagues.Douglass and her colleagues are anthropologists andethnographerswhosetout toinvestigatethehumanexperience behind theEuropean demographictrendof lower fertilityrates.In the courseof exploringthebasisof lowerfertilityrates,theyinevitablyexploredthelargerquestion of how thenature ofyoungpeople'sliveshavechangednow thattheynolonger devote their twenties mainly to marriage and caring for young children.Consequently,thebookcontains a greatdeal of fascinatingand important information on emergingadulthood.  \n\nDouglass andcolleagues describe the diversity thatexists across Europe,butthe consistent theme acrosscountriesisthatyoungpeopleall overEuropewanttoenjoy aperiodofemergingadultfreedomandindependencebeyondadolescencebefore they commit themselves to theenduringresponsibilities of adulthood.Three of the chaptersprovideagoodillustrationof thisunity despitediversity,inNorway,Spain, andtheCzechRepublic.  \n\nIn thechapteronNorway,Ravn(2005)describeshowyoungNorwegianspreter to enjoy a long emerging adulthoodbefore they take onparenthood.AsRavn observes, “Tobe“ready forchildren”[is]tohave lived inan independenthousehold for some years;to have finishedone's education;tohave been employed for at least ayear;to havelivedwith(orbeenmarriedto)thepartnerofchoiceforsometime andtohave done some traveling or other self-developing activities²(2005,p.41).There is a clear socialnorm that emerging adulthood‘should’be enjoyedfor someyearsbeforefull adulthood is entered.Norwegians believe that emerging adults‘should not get establishedtooearly,theyshouldnotbecometoomainstream,theyshoulddevelop themselves withregardtotraveling andeducationandtheyshouldprovide themselves with a good“tasteof life”（Ravn 2005,p.43).  \n\nIn the chapter on Spain,Douglass describes her own ethnographicresearch.In recent decades themedianmarriage age inSpainhasrisen to28and thefertilityrate hasplungedto thelowestintheworlddespiteastrongcultural traditionof large extendedfamilies.There are a variety ofreasons for thischange,includingnew opportunitiesforwomen,but thelargestreasonappearstobethatyoungSpaniards prefer to focusin their twenties on enjoying the freedom and fun of emerging adulthood.Douglassobserves,Spaniardsnotonly entertain themselvesbybecoming importance of structural factors is in the area of unemployment.Rates of unemployment inEurope are typically about twice as high for emerging adults (ages 18-25) as for other adults,and are especially high in southern Europe (Sneeding&Phillips2002).Clearly theexperienceofstrivingtofindemploymentyet being unable to do so is frustrating and demoralizing for emerging adults.For example,one studyin sixEuropean countriesreported highrates ofpsychological distress among emerging adults who were unemployed,and in a longitudinal follow upfoundthatthedistresshadeasedsixmonthslaterforthosewhohadfoundafulltime orpart-timejob orhadgone back to school(Bjarnason&Sigurdardottir2003). Ihave found evidence of similar distress amongunemployed emerging adults in the USA,especially among African Americans,for whom the disadvantage of being young is frequently compoundedby low educational attainment anddiscrimination byemployers（Arnett2004),primarily because they aremore likely tobefromlower SESbackgrounds andconsequently take on earlierresponsibilities in their families (Arnett,2003).  \n\nagain,a years af strivefc for a lo tolive governi they lea anexte possibi meand differei makef  \n\nWell of clas: withtl asthe workin postpc lation thesis, achiev also st havetheb  \n\nIn other areas,structural factors may beless important.For example,Ihave performed numerous studies investigating emerging adultsviews of whatitmeans to reachadulthood（Arnett1994,1997,1998,2001,2003a,2004）.Originally,Iexpected tofindsocial classdifferences,with lowsocio-economic status(SES)emergingadults especially favoring economic transitions such as becoming employed full time. However,Ihavefoundconsistentlythat,acrossESgroups,thesamefourcriteriar adulthood end up at the top:accept responsibility for your actions,make independent decisions,becomemore considerateofothers,andbecomefinancially independent.Becoming employedfull-timeranksrelativelylow acrossSES groups,as dotherestof the traditional criteria foradulthood,especiallyfinishingeducationand marriage.Structuralfactorsmattermorefor one's subjective ofreaching adulthood. AfricanAmerican andLatino emerging adults aremorelikely thanWhitestofeel they havereached adulthoodprimarilybecausetheyaremorelikelytobefromlowerEs backgrounds(Arnett2003a).  \n\nThwithhas1becoitheLtheveconwom2003wasfigurcharfronlivesT  \n\nStructural factors alsoseem tohave onlya limitedrelationtowhatI haveproposed as the five principal features of adulthood (i.e.,emerging adulthood as the age of identityexplorationshageofinstabilitythagffelinginbweentself-ocusd age,and the age ofpossibilities).In studies testing these theoretical proposals （Reifman et al.2006),emerging adultswere distinguishedfromhigher and lower age groups on each of these dimensions,and theresponses of working-class andmiddleclass emerging adultswerenot significantly different.  \n\nPerhapssocialclasswill befoundtobeamoreimportantvariableforEuropean emerging adults than it is for Americans. Or perhaps not.As noted earlier,the European emerging adults describedbyDouglass and colleagues soundremarkably similar to the American emerging adults I have described.It may be,in fact,that social classmatters lessforEuropean emerging adults than it doesfor emerging adults in theUSA,at least in some respects.In theUSA,emerging adults areexpected to leavehome at around age18or19,andmost do.Some staylonger,some comeback  \n\nstru othe that adu tesof adults Europe entyet s.For logical ollowa full2003). in the being nation lower milies  \n\nhave ansto )ected adults time. iafor make icially ps,as nand n00d.

theirfamilies,whom theymay continue tolivewithuntilage30 orevenbeyond,andnorthern Europeansfromtheir governments,who typicallyprovide emergingadultswitha stipendforyears after they leavehome.Thusin oneway or another Europeans can expect more support for anextendedperiodofemergingadulthoodthatallowsthem to tryoutvarious possibilitiesinloveandworkwhile alsolivingan activeleisurelife,astheygradually meander theirwaytowardsfulladulthood.Furthermore,therangeofsocialclass differencesisnarrower inmostEuropean countries thanit isn theUsA,whichmay make for fewer differences between emerging adults of different social classes.  \n\nWell,then,perhapsitsdifferent,atleast,ntheUK?Perhapsthertsh traan of classstratificationmakesfor sharper class divisionsin emerging adulthood aswell, with those inthemiddle class experiencingtheir late teensand twentiesmuchmore astheageofidentityexplorationstheageofossibilitie,andsoon,thanthoseinhe working class.Bynner observes that his cohort analysis shows that‘Increasing postponement of family commitments accompanying rising human capital accumulation is stronglyevidentfrom thesefigures inlinewith theEmergingAdulthood thesis，but he adds thatExtendedparticipationin education andoccupational achievementwasconcentratedinthemost advantaged sections ofsociety,andwas alsostronglyrelatedtoqualificationsgained.Herethegapbetween the haves and the have-notswas actuallygettingwider,witha substantial minority ofyoungpeople at thehottomendof thesocialscale,fallingsubstantiallybehindtherest  \n\nThispoint iswell taken.Infact,a similar phenomenon has taken place in tneUA, with the gap betweenuniversity graduates and others growingwider as the economy has become more information-basedand high-payingmanufacturing jobs have becomescarce(National CenterforEducationStatistics2005).Still,Iwouldadd that theUKhas changedagreat deal sinceBynner'slatest cohort,born in1970,entered the work force nearly 20years ago.TheBritish economy hasundergone dramatic economicrestructuring that has led to new opportunities,especially for young women,aswell asnewdifficulties,especiallyforworking-classyoungmen(McDowell 2003).Furthermore,as Table1 shows,by 2000 the medianmarriageage in the UK was30.4yearsformen and28.3yearsforwomen,overfouryearshigher than the figures presented by Bynner.This,too,suggests thelikelihood of dramaticrecent changes in the lives of British emerging adults.It will beimportant to addfindings from a cohort ofemergingadultsbornin theperiod1985-1990,toseehow their livesmavbe similar toordifferentfrom thecohortsBynnerdescribed.  \n\nTheemphasisof theEuropeanresearchbyBynner andothershasbeenmainiyol structural anddemographicvariables,and thereismuchtobelearned about the otheraspectsof thelivesofemerging adults.Onehypothesisthat I wouldpropose is that inEurope,asintheUSA,andinfact in all industrialized countries,foremerging adults their choice of workisnowprimarilyidentity-based.Formost emerging adults  \n\nhistory arebey reflect childre adoles thene adultt  \n\nit isnolonger enough simply to earn awage thatputs a roof over one'shead and bread on the table,as itmay have been in previous generations.Today emerging adultswish tofind a job that is an expressionof theiridentity,not just away to make moneybutan activity thatispersonallyfuliling andenjoyable.Thus thefrequent job changes that occur during the twenties inEuropean countries(aswell as in the USA)maybeexplainednotonlyby structuralfactors,specificallythereluctanceof employerstohirenewemployeesbecauseof lawsthatmakeitdifficult tofirepeople once theyhavebeenhired,butalsobyemergingadultssearchforajobthatmathes their identity.  \n\nFurthermore,I hypothesize that the entire European educational and school-toworksystem,whichwasdevelopeddecadesagowhenthemeaningandpurposeof workwasquitedifferent,isincompatiblewithemergingadultsdesirestotrydifferent possibleeducationalandoccupational pathsuntil theyfindtheonethatprovidesthe right identitymatch,and is increasingly experiencedby them as intolerablyrigid and inflexible.The clarification of one'sidentityissomething that takes place primarily in emergingadulthood,notin adolescence.Consequently,thepervasiverequirementin Europe that individuals decide by age15whichgeneral occupationalpath to follow will beincreasinglyresistedby emergingadults.Astheiridentitiesbecome clearerin theirlate teens andperhaps earlytwenties,theywill seek to changeeducational and occupationalpathstomatchtheir identityneeds,andthey willpress their school officialsandgovernments toallowthemtodoso.  \n\nAS   \nperioc   \nhave   \nphase   \nthe a   \ninten   \ncanne   \ndiffer   \nthey   \ninth   \nthing   \nand:   \nare eithe with S Not devi as1

education,leaving home,and marriage that have previously dominated researchon the18-29year ageperiod.In thenext section,Iprovidea more detailed argumentfor thepotentialfruitfulnessof thetheoryofemerging adulthood.  \n\n# Why‘Emerging Adulthood?  \n\nAs Bynner notes,many other scholars have observed over thepast 30years that higher education ismorewidespread and is lasting longer,that themedian marriage agehasrisensharply,and thatyoungpeoplehavefewerchildrenandwait longerto have theirfirst one.So,what is different about‘emerging adulthood，andwhy isthat conceptpreferabletohow thesechangeshavebeendescribedinthepast?  \n\nwo per Pc chi aft ad  \n\nEuropeansocialscientistshavelongusedtheterm‘youth’todescribeadolescence, andasBynnerstatesthey havegenerallyrespondedtothe later entryinto adultroles byregardingit as an extensionof theyouthphase'IntheUSA,too,youth’hasbeen used,butina differentway.KennethKeniston（1971)used this term todescribe a period afteradolescencebutbeforefull adulthoodand applied it tothecollege studentactivistshe studiedin thelate1960s,and some Americansocial scientists sincethattimehaveused‘youth'inthisway.  \n\nur ati ac er  \n\nHowever,youth’is a term thathasnumerous deficiencies.First,itis aword that has a long history (at least inEnglish) and has been used elastically during that  \n\n: head and emerging iy tomake efrequent Ias in the uctance of fire people itmatches school-tourposeof ydifferent ovidesthe rigidand imarily in rement in tofollow clearerin ional and eir school ideas and tssuch as ominated e

throughpuberty orpersonswho arebeyondpubertybutnotfully adult,but also children.In theUSA,thishistory is reflected today in terms such as‘youthorganizations,which are organizationsfor children andperhaps adolescents,almost never for personswho are beyond adolescence.Thus‘youth'is toovague and elastic a term tobeuseful in describing thenew andunprecedentedperiod thatnowlies after adolescencebutbeforefull adulthood.  \n\nAsecondproblemwithyouth’isthat it isoftenintendedtoincludenotjusta periodafteradolescence,butadolescenceaswell.Asnoted,Europeansocialscientists havelargelyregardedtheperiod after adolescenceasanextensionoftheyouth phasebut thispracticefailstorecognize theimportant differences that existbetween theageperiodfrom10to17and theageperiodfrom18to25.Anyword that is intended tobeapplied topeopleinthe entire agerangefrom10 or12until at least 25 cannot possiblywork,because thetypical10,12,15or17year old is simply too different from the typical 25yearold.Adolescents(ages 10-17) havein common that they aregoingthroughpuberty,they areattendingecondaryschool,andtheyarelive in their parentshousehold and are financially dependent on them.None of these things are truefor emerging adults(ages 18-25).They have reached sexual maturity and are no longer going through puberty.They are no longer in secondary school but arepursuingawidevarietyof differentcombinations of schoolandwork.They have eithermovedoutof theirparentshouseholdorhave considerablymore autonomy withinthehousehold.  \n\nSometimes the agerangefor‘youthis specified as15-24,but thisis evenworse. Nothinghappensat age15 thatmakes it worthy as the startingageofanew developmentalperiod.Pubertybeginsearlierandendslater,15yearoldsareaslikely as14yearolds tobelivingwithandfinanciallydependentontheirparents,15year olds arenowherenearfull-timework ormarriageorparenthood.True,15isoften the agewhenprimaryschoolends,butsomeformofsecondaryeducationcontinuesfor yearsformostpeople.  \n\nBynnermentionedthatpostadolescencehasalsobeenused,butthisterm suliers frommany of the same deficiencies as‘youthmainly thelackof a clearmeaning that woulddistinguishit from adolescenceoryoung adulthood.Furthermore,tocall the periodpostadolescence’is defining it bywhat it is not rather thanby what it is. ‘Postadolescenceis not exactly adolescencebut what isit,then?We do not call childhoodpost-infancyor adolescencepost-childhoodsoletusnot calltheperiod after adolescence‘postadolescenceNor arelate adolescenceor‘thetransition to adulthood’adequate,asI haveexplainedelsewhere(Arnett2004).  \n\nEmergingadulthood’ispreferablebecauseit isanew term fora new ana unprecedentedphenomenon-thelongperiodofyears thatnowliesbetweenthe attainmentofbiologicalmaturityandtheentranceintostableadultroles.Unlike youth，the term emergingadulthoodclearlydistinguishesthisperiodfrom the adolescencethatprecedesit and theyoung adulthood thatfollows it.Understanding emerging adulthood as a developmental periodinits ownright leadsusto ask a wide range of questions that havebeen asked about other developmental periodsbuthave been neglected up to now with regard to this one.What is their cognitive developmentlike,and how do they think about practicalproblems and social relations differently than adolescents do?What do they aspire to in their love relationshipsandhowdoesthismatchuporfail tomatchupwithwhat theyactually find? What kinds of media do they use, and for what purposes? And many, many other questions about allaspectsof theirlives.Aforthcomingbookillustratesthe ideas and questions generatedby using the theory of emergingadulthood(Arnett & Tanner2006),andhopefullythechaptersinthatbookwillbethefirstfruitsofmany tocome.  \n\nBut doesemerging adulthood’ mean that people in this age period will be describedhomogeneouslywithoutregardtothestructuralandindividualdifferences that distinguish them,asBynner fears?I donot thinkthiswill be the case.Thereis no reason why this should be a greater fearwithrespect to emerging adulthood than withrespect to any other developmentalperiod.Infact,asIhave emphasized in everythingI havewritten aboutit,the heterogeneityof emerging adulthood isoneof themostimportantcharacteristicsofit.Children andadolescentshaveinstitutional structures of compulsory schooling andresidencewithin the family,young adults and beyond have institutional structures of long-term employment,marriage,and parenthood,butemerging adulthood is a time that is exceptionally unstructured by institutions（Arnett2005,2006forthcoming）.Anyinstitutionalparticipation they doengage in,most notably continued education,is volitional rather than compulsory.Consequently,the life circumstances ofemerging adults are extremely diverse and theirpathwaysinlove andworkchangefrequently.Itiscrucial to the studyofemergingadulthood toportray thediversityof these circumstances and pathways.  \n\nEvenaswerecognizeandinvestigate their diversity,itisimportant touse the overarching term‘emerging adulthood’to describe the age period.As noted, conceptualizing it as a distinct developmental period is useful because doing so leadsusto askquestionsweaskaboutotherdevelopmentalperiods and alsoto consider what questions might be unique to this age period. Within Europe, emergingadultsindifferentcountrieswillnodoubt have different experiencesduring thisperiod(Douglass 2005),and these differences areimportant to explore and describe.Nevertheless,the demographic patterns reflecting the development ofa period of emergingadulthood—more widespreadand later education,later marriage,and later and fewer childrenare remarkably similar across Western Europe andareclearlyheadedin thesamedirectioninEasternEurope.  \n\nButwhat about thosewhodonot obtain highereducationand/orwhomarry and have theirfirst childrelatively early;dothey experience emerging adulthood?Thisisa fascinating question,worthy of extensiveinvestigation.Myresponse at this point would beyes,most of them have a period of emerging adulthood, although it may be shorter.Frominterviewswith emerging adults intheUSA,I havefound that those who donot obtain higher education aresimilar inmanykeyways to thosewho do  \n\nhave nitive ;ocial love ually nany sthe ett& nany llbe ences isno than din neof ional and and ured they than mely ）the and the oted, gso oto rope, iring and ofa later stern and sisa ooint aybe hose odo  \n\nobtain higher education (Amet 2004)Both experience emergin aduthoodas the aefitxrantftiltlfa felingineean thaofpsbiteuhtareifeint contentftxxafteyxor college students change educational directions while non-cllege emerging adults changejobs. ainaadulthoodis  \n\nThe one event that seems to meto exclude a periodof emergugau havingachildnnesteensThedemandsf caringforayoung childaresotn thattlttttr promotgdrafdraff possbilitehaefoud thatthewpatsearlyfllketym adultsvernightwhen the child is born, rather than experiencing a long period of feeling in-between adolescence and adulthood(Arnett 1998,2004). :lactillintheir  \n\nHowever,theproportionofyoungpeoplewhobecomeparentsw teensorryarlywenteismalland shrningyearlyEpeancoutreuh smaller eventhanitheAhsit msposibleandpotntilldesrabl desribasinauhwil inthis ageridwdtft thnrmativexrieefeingadultd but thisistrfhrdevlpentl priods aswellForxalee adlesetsinmlib adultsasretiringfrmtheworkforcbutmayf thmcontinutoworktrough theirsixties oreven seventies.  \n\n# Conclusion  \n\nThetheoryofemerging adulthoodcanbeausefulframeworkevenaswexploreand desribederitythat xists amng thmtwiinandtecouti doubt such investigations wil lead to modifications and adaptations of the fve featurestha haveprposed ascharactristicfmeinadtsinthUAWat seemsndisutableisthat theiaagefentengmaraand parnthodh risen to unprecedented heights and is now in the late twenties or beyond in every industralized country, thatmore people obtain at least some post-secondary educationtoda tha at anytein thpastand that pplechange joband loveparterandresdencerfrquentlythetisthananylatr oflifeInmyvithisisnoughtrit recognitn tha eparatperid fe now existsbetween adolescenceand young adulthood.I ampleased thatByner believesthethoryofmergingadulthoodworkswellinmanywaysand Iamopl thatmyrpeancolleauewillesimilarlyersuaedthathiswperidlfe reauiresanew termwithadistinctivemeaning. aavarvthingIhave  \n\nUsing the term‘emerging adulthood’ does not mean embracug c proposd about what t continIbelevemering adulood’ isauseful tm for 18-25year oldsnindustralied societiesbutwhat precisely thisperiodhols developmentallyis anexcitingquestionwe haveonlybeguntoexplore.I lookforward to joiningmyEuropean colleagues in this enterprise.  \n\n# References  \n\nAquilino,W.S.(2006）‘Family relationships and support systems inemerging adulthoodin ComingofAgeinthe2istCentury:TheLivesandContextsofEmergingAdultsedsI.J.Arett & J.Tanner,American Psychological Association,Washington DC,pp.193218.   \nArnett,.J.(1994)Are college students adults?Theirconceptions of the transition toadulthood, Jounal of Adultevelopment,vol 1,pp.154168.   \nArnett,J(1997）Youngoplesconceptionsof thetransitiontoadulthoodYouthocietyl. 29,pp.1-23.   \nArnet,J.J(1998）Learning tostand alone:the contemporaryAmerican transition to adulthood in cultural and historical context，HumanDevelopment,ol41,pp.295315.   \nArnett,1.1.(20o1）Conceptionsof the transition toadulthood:perspectivesfrom adolescence midif   \nArnett,1.
