Demonstration of etoricoxib’s efficacy vs placebo and comparison of its efficacy to ibuprofen were assessed using three co-primary endpoints: Western Ontario and McMaster’s University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale (WOMAC-PS); WOMAC Physical Function Subscale (WOMAC-PFS); and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS). Each primary endpoint utilizes a $0{-}100\\mathrm{mm}$ visual analog scale. To demonstrate comparable efficacy of etoricoxib vs ibuprofen, the $95\\%$ confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in the least squares (LS) mean change over 12 weeks for all three co-primary endpoints had to fall within $\\pm10\\mathsf{m m}$ . Safety and tolerability data were collected throughout the study.  \n\nResults: Mean baseline values for the three co-primary endpoints ranged from 62.52 to $70.14\\mathrm{mm}$ . Both etoricoxib and ibuprofen demonstrated superior $(P\\leq0.002)$ efficacy for all primary endpoints. The LS mean (mm) changes $(95\\%$ CI) over 12 weeks for etoricoxib and ibuprofen, respectively, compared to placebo were given as follows: WOMAC-PS: $-11.66$ $(-16.31\\$ , $-7.01)$ and $_{-7.62}$ (\u000412.30, \u00042.94); WOMAC-PFS: \u000410.15 (\u000414.74, \u00045.57) and \u00047.23 (\u000411.85, \u00042.61); PGADS: \u000411.65 $(-16.81\\$ , $-6.50)$ and $-8.11$ $(-13.30,-2.92)$ . The efficacy of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ was comparable to ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg}$ . All treatments were similarly well tolerated.  \n\nConclusion: Treatment with etoricoxib 30 mg q.d. provides superior efficacy vs placebo and comparable clinical efficacy vs ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg}$ (800 mg t.i.d.) for the treatment of OA of the hip and knee.   \n$\\circledcirc$ 2007 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

In its severe form, the chronic pain of OA can lead to a significant reduction in the overall quality of life in patients of any age1e4. OA of the knee and hip can be quite disabling since these are major weight-bearing joints5. Given current projections indicating that OA could be the fourth leading cause of disability on a world-wide basis by the year 2020, the need for multiple treatment options exists6.  \n\nAcetaminophen and non-pharmacologic approaches, such as exercise and improvement of joint biomechanics, are considered first-line treatment options for patients with $\\mathtt{O A}^{7,8}$ . However, traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat the pain and symptoms associated with this disease7,9,10. Nevertheless, there is a greatly elevated risk of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity associated with traditional NSAIDs due to their additional inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) isoenzyme. This risk of NSAID-induced GI toxicity increases in a linear fashion with age11.  \n\nEtoricoxib is a member of the COX-2 selective inhibitor class of NSAIDs and exhibits a reduced risk of GI toxicity compared to traditional NSAIDs12,13. Recent long-term randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated an increased time-dependent risk of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events with other COX-2 selective NSAIDs compared with placebo14,15. Meta-analyses and reviews by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe indicate that this risk likely extends to traditional NSAIDs16e19.  \n\nEtoricoxib’s anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy for the treatment of acute and chronic pain have been established in multiple studies using a once daily dosing regimen and is reviewed elsewhere20. In countries where it is approved, the recommended once daily dose of etoricoxib for the treatment of OA is 60 mg. The purpose of this study, the second of two replicate, randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled trials, was to examine the efficacy as well as the safety and tolerability of etoricoxib 30 mg q.d. compared to placebo and ibuprofen $800\\mathsf{m g}$ t.i.d. in patients with OA of the knee or hip. In the first of these two studies (Sponsor protocol number 071), the efficacy of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ was found to be superior to placebo and comparable to ibuprofen 2400 mg for the treatment of OA of the hip and knee21. The identification of lower effective doses of NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors is important in the context of mechanismbased side effects such as edema and hypertension, which are known to be dose-related.  \n\n# Patients and methods  \n\nThe protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the study.  \n\nThis 12-week, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled trial was conducted in 548 patients in 49 centers (41 in the United States and eight in Latin America) under doubleblind (with in-house blinding) conditions to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ compared to placebo and ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. for the treatment of OA of the knee and hip. Otherwise healthy male and female OA patients 40 years or older, were enrolled. Women of child-bearing potential were determined to be in a nongravid state and were instructed to use contraceptive measures during the study. Eligible patients were required to have a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of OA of the knee or hip for at least the previous 6 months or were newly diagnosed patients with clinical symptoms consistent with OA of the study joint for at least the previous 6 months. All patients were required to have pain on motion or weight bearing for the majority of days during the previous month, which was partially relieved by rest. Radiographic criteria included joint space narrowing for hip OA. Patients with knee OA were required to have both tibiofemoral osteophytes and tibiofemoral joint space narrowing. All eligible patients met American Rheumatism Association (ARA) functional class I, II, or III criteria22 and were required to have been using NSAIDs or acetaminophen to treat their OA. The primary source of pain for each patient was in the lower extremity. In cases where both knees and/or hips were affected, the most painful joint was selected for study evaluation. Patients who were regular users of NSAIDs (at least 25 of the last 30 days preceding enrollment) were required to have a prestudy score of less than $80\\mathrm{mm}$ (based on the 0e100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]) for patient assessment of pain while walking on a flat surface. Following cessation of NSAID therapy (washout period) patients were instructed to return to the clinic upon experiencing a flare of OA pain. Prespecified washout periods for the various prior NSAIDs that were used ranged from 3 to 20 days. A sufficient flare within the washout period was defined as a patient-reported pain score of at least $40\\:\\mathsf{m m}$ while the patient walked on a flat surface, and was at least $15m m$ greater than that recorded at the prestudy visit as well as a worsening of at least one point ( $\\mathrm{\\sf~O}-$ to 5-point Likert scale) for Investigator Global Assessment of Disease Status (IGADS).  \n\nPatients who were classified as acetaminophen users $(1.2\\mathrm{-}4\\:9\\$ of acetaminophen daily for at least 25 of the last 30 days preceding enrollment) reported no NSAID use for treatment of their OA and were required to have minimum scores of $40\\:\\mathrm{mm}$ for patient-reported pain while walking on a flat surface and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS), and an IGADS of fair, poor, or very poor. The number of acetaminophen users at each study site was limited to $20\\%$ , since this agent acts only as an analgesic, and unlike etoricoxib and ibuprofen, does not have antiinflammatory activity.  \n\nAll patients were required to stop taking rescue acetaminophen at least $12\\mathsf{h}$ ( $24\\mathsf{h}$ if they were using extendedrelease formulations) prior to all treatment visits and for acetaminophen users only, prior to screening.  \n\n# EXCLUSION CRITERIA  \n\nPatients were excluded if they had medical conditions, such as recent joint injuries or rheumatologic, autoimmune, or musculoskeletal diseases that could confound or interfere with efficacy evaluations.  \n\n# TREATMENT  \n\nQualified patients were randomized to receive placebo, etoricoxib 30 mg q.d., or ibuprofen $800\\mathsf{m g}$ t.i.d. for 12 weeks. Within each study center, patients were randomly allocated using a computer-generated allocation schedule; allocation was not stratified in this study. All study personnel, including investigators, study site personnel, patients, monitors, central laboratory and other study personnel, remained blinded to treatment allocation throughout the study. Study medication was supplied in two coded study bottles, labeled ‘‘bottle A’’ (containing either etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ tablets or matching placebo) and ‘‘bottle B’’ (containing either ibuprofen 800 mg tablets or matching placebo). Patients were instructed to take one tablet in the morning from bottle A and one tablet in the morning, afternoon, and evening from bottle B. Acetaminophen was provided as rescue medication for pain, if needed. Treatment compliance and amount of rescue acetaminophen use were determined by tablet counts.  \n\n# INCLUDED AND EXCLUDED MEDICATIONS  \n\nPatients were allowed to continue use of chronic medications provided they remained on stable doses 2 weeks before and throughout the 12 weeks of the study. The use of intra-articular corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid injections to the study knee within the previous 3 months, use of immunosuppressants within the previous 3 months, corticosteroid use by any systemic route, and hyaluronic acid injections or intra-articular corticosteroids for any other joint in the previous month were not permitted. Patients taking stable doses of glucosamine or chondroitin sulfate for at least 6 months prior to the study were allowed to enroll. Low-dose aspirin $\\leq100$ mg daily) use for cardioprophylaxis was permitted; however, patients were excluded if they were required to take any other therapy to inhibit platelet aggregation. Gastroprotective agents (GPAs), such as proton pump inhibitors, $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$ -receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and misoprostol, were allowed as necessary.  \n\n# EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  \n\nEfficacy was evaluated at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks following initiation of therapy. Primary endpoints included the Western Ontario and McMaster’s University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) visual analog (VA) 3.0 pain (WOMAC-PS) and physical function (WOMAC-PFS) subscales and the PGADS $(0{-}100\\mathsf{m m}^{\\mathsf{^{*}}}\\mathsf{V A S})^{23-25}$ . Secondary and other endpoints included the Patient Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART; 0e4 point Likert scale), the IGADS (0e4 point Likert scale), the WOMAC stiffness subscale $(0{-}100\\mathsf{m m}\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S})$ , the WOMAC questionnaire overall score and subscale averages, the Investigator Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (IGART; 0e4 point Likert scale), joint tenderness (0e3 point Likert scale), the proportion of patients discontinuing due to lack of efficacy, rescue acetaminophen use, and the WOMAC pain while walking on a flat surface questionnaire (0e100 mm VAS). Exploratory endpoints included the WOMAC nighttime pain and WOMAC 3.0 stiffness upon first awakening subscales $(0{-}100\\mathsf{m m}\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S})$ .  \n\n# SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY ASSESSMENTS  \n\nAdverse experiences (AEs) were recorded throughout the study and for 14 days after the last dose of study drug. Physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and AEs were recorded throughout the study to assess safety.  \n\nSerious AEs were defined as those events that resulted in death, were life threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, or caused persistent or significant disability or incapacity. AEs that were determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely drug-related were classified as drug-related. Prespecified safety-related endpoints, including the proportion of patients with edema-related AEs; hypertension-related AEs; AEs of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary edema, or cardiac failure; and discontinuation due to digestive system or abdominal pain AEs, edema-related AEs, or hypertension-related AEs were also recorded to more closely examine GI safety and possible clinical sequelae of modulating renal prostaglandin biosynthesis. Prior to initiation of the study, blinded, external adjudication committees were established to evaluate any investigator-reported thrombotic cardiovascular serious AEs (thrombotic CV events) or potential upper GI perforations, ulcers, or bleeds that occurred during the trial.  \n\n# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  \n\nFor power calculations, the estimates for variability and assumed mean changes for each treatment group were based on results from three previous etoricoxib and two previous rofecoxib randomized, placebo-controlled studies in patients with $\\mathrm{OA}^{26-30}$ . Results from these studies suggested that the expected differences between responses to etoricoxib relative to placebo were approximately $11.9\\mathrm{mm}$ for the WOMAC-PS, $10.0\\mathrm{mm}$ for the WOMACPFS, and $13.5\\mathrm{mm}$ for the PGADS. Using variability estimates from the two etoricoxib Phase III studies27,28, it was predicted that planned sample sizes of 100 placebo patients and 200 etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ patients provided $>97\\%$ power to detect $a=0.050$ , two-sided) these expected mean differences for the three co-primary endpoints. The modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population was used in all efficacy analyses and is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and who provided a baseline and at least one post-baseline observation.  \n\nThe time-weighted mean changes from baseline for each efficacy endpoint were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and primary OA study joint as the main effects and the baseline value as the covariate. For endpoints without a relevant baseline measurement, the on-treatment response was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).  \n\nThe between-treatment comparisons of interest were divided into three families of tests, using the Dunnette Tamhane approach31; (1) testing of the efficacy of etoricoxib relative to placebo, (2) comparing the relative efficacy of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ to ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg}$ and (3) evaluating the study sensitivity, i.e., comparing ibuprofen to placebo. The different between-treatment comparisons in each family addressed related yet different questions. In addition, there was only one test within each family; therefore, no adjustment for multiple between-treatment comparisons was made between these three families of tests. Since the primary hypothesis had to be satisfied for each of the three primary endpoints, the overall alpha level was ${<}0.050$ and no adjustment was necessary. For comparisons to placebo, all three primary endpoints were required to reach statistical significance at $\\alpha=0.050$ , two-tailed.  \n\nStatistical tests and estimators of the secondary endpoints and other secondary statistical analyses were supportive and helped in interpreting the primary analyses, establishing efficacy profiles, and checking the consistency of findings for the primary endpoints. Therefore, no multiple testing adjustments were made. All tests for difference in means were made at the customary two-sided $\\alpha=0.050$ level.  \n\nTo demonstrate comparable efficacy of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ q.d. and ibuprofen $800\\mathsf{m g}$ t.i.d., the $95\\%$ confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean differences in the time-weighted average response between the two groups had to fall entirely within $\\pm10\\mathsf{m m}$ on a $100\\mathrm{mm}$ VAS for all three co-primary endpoints. The study was designed to provide greater than $95\\%$ power to yield all three CIs within $\\pm10\\mathrm{mm}$ if true differences in efficacy between etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ and ibuprofen 2400 mg were zero.  \n\nThe incidences of prespecified clinical AEs and laboratory AEs of interest in the two active treatment groups were individually compared with the incidence in the placebo group using Fisher’s exact test. Differences between treatment groups in proportions of patients with AEs or those exceeding predefined limits of change in laboratory safety parameters were evaluated using $95\\%$ CIs calculated by the Wilson’s score method.  \n\n# Results  \n\n# PATIENTS  \n\nA total of 548 of the 861 patients screened met the eligibility criteria and were randomized (Fig. 1). Baseline patient characteristics were similar among the treatment groups (Table I). The majority of enrolled patients were female. The median age of the study population was 63 years, and the majority of patients $(56\\%)$ were over 60 years and $22\\%$ were over 70 years. The mean duration of OA was 6.6 years, and the majority of patients were ARA functional class II. There were small insignificant differences among treatment groups in the proportions of patients who were classified as ARA functional class I, II, and III. Given the overlap between the diagnostic entry criteria used and those of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria, all patients with hip OA and all patients ${>}50$ years of age with knee OA also met ACR diagnostic criteria32. Although it is likely that knee OA patients $_{<50}$ years of age also met ACR criteria, this was not specifically documented as we did not specifically require patients to have one of the two ACR criteria of crepitus or stiffness $<30$ min. Of note, $88\\%$ of patients enrolled were ${>}50$ years of age.  \n\nMost patients $(83\\%)$ had OA of the knee and $89\\%$ were NSAID users at screening. A small percentage of patients $(4.2\\%)$ had a prior medical history of confirmed gastric or duodenal ulcer or upper GI bleeding. Baseline characteristics (e.g., percentage of patients with OA of the knee, ARA functional class, and mean duration of disease) for the patients in this study were similar to those in other studies of etoricoxib in patients with $\\mathrm{OA}^{26-28}$ . The most common secondary diagnosis at baseline was hypertension $(46.4\\%$ of the patients). A total of four, seven, and four patients in the placebo, etoricoxib, and ibuprofen groups, respectively, were excluded from the MITT analysis for any of the three co-primary efficacy endpoints.  \n\n# EFFICACY  \n\nMean values for all efficacy endpoints were qualitatively similar among the treatment groups at baseline (Table II). Near-maximal efficacy was achieved with both active treatments by the first visit following initiation of treatments (week 2), followed by slight continued improvement for all primary endpoints through 12 weeks [Fig. 2(a)e(c)]. There were no significant treatment-by-baseline-covariate (i.e., age group $[<65$ years, ${\\ge}65$ years], gender, racial background, ARA functional class, or duration of OA) or treatment-by-study-joint interactions observed. Results of the treatment comparisons of the last observed value were consistent with those of the time-weighted average responses over the 12-week treatment period.  \n\n![](images/fc4782493f9c0106b0dc459c6345f7d4f87513c83840b9cca5781a962c8bc746.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Disposition of patients with OA enrolled in 12-week evaluation of etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ and ibuprofen 2400 mg vs placebo. y: The most common reasons patients were not randomized were due to failure to meet one or more inclusion criteria (i.e., not satisfying flare criteria and having a clinical diagnosis of OA based on clinical and radiographic criteria) or because one or more exclusion criteria were met (i.e., having an abnormal laboratory safety test result). $^{\\ddagger}$ : Other reasons for discontinuation included lost to follow-up; unknown reason; patient moved; patient withdrew consent; and protocol deviation.  \n\nTable I Baseline characteristics for patients enrolled in clinical study of etoricoxib and ibuprofen for treatment of OA   \n\n![](images/6ab07b8169b6ac75ba1a92643c74a62174fba4b0e92c7d84011ee4c37c107774.jpg)  \n\nFor all co-primary endpoints, both etoricoxib and ibuprofen were significantly more effective $(P\\leq0.002)$ than placebo [Fig. 2(d) and Table II]. Etoricoxib met the predefined criteria for comparability to ibuprofen for all co-primary endpoints; additionally, etoricoxib demonstrated statistical superiority $(P<0.05)$ over ibuprofen for the WOMAC-PS, a co-primary endpoint. Analyses of key secondary endpoints, which included PGART, IGADS, WOMAC stiffness subscale, and WOMAC overall score and subscale averages, provided an additional perspective of etoricoxib’s overall efficacy profile for the treatment of OA compared with the efficacy of ibuprofen and placebo. Etoricoxib and ibuprofen demonstrated comparable treatment effects, which were superior to placebo (Table II) for these secondary endpoints. These treatment effects were consistent with those of the co-primary endpoints.  \n\nFrom an exploratory post hoc analysis it was determined that $80.0\\%$ , $70.1\\%$ , and $55.1\\%$ of patients in the etoricoxib, ibuprofen, and placebo group, respectively, achieved what can be considered to be a minimally clinically important improvement33 $(\\geq15\\%$ improvement from baseline) for the WOMAC-PS. Similar response rates of $72.6\\%$ , $66.5\\%$ , and $53.2\\%$ for WOMAC-PFS and $77.7\\%$ , $73.9\\%$ , and $61.7\\%$ for PGADS for etoricoxib, ibuprofen, and placebo, respectively, were observed.  \n\nResults for other secondary and exploratory endpoints were also consistent with results for the co-primary endpoints. Patients on etoricoxib experienced a 1.54 point $(95\\%$ CI: 1.40, 1.68) improvement of IGART and $-33.75\\mathrm{mm}$ ( $95\\%$ CI: $-37.17$ , $-30.33\\mathrm{mm}$ ) improvement of pain status when walking on a flat surface (WOMAC score). This was similar to the improvements observed in patients taking ibuprofen (1.58 $[95\\%$ CI: 1.44, 1.73] and $-32.01$ $[95\\%$ CI: $-35.44$ , $-28.57]$ for IGART and pain status when walking on a flat surface, respectively). When compared with placebo, treatment with etoricoxib provided significant reduction of study joint tenderness $(P=0.005)$ , whereas reduction of study joint tenderness following ibuprofen therapy only approached significance $\\overset{\\prime}{P=}0.076\\$ . Both etoricoxib and ibuprofen significantly reduced night pain and stiffness upon awakening vs placebo $(P\\leq0.016)$ . Although the treatment effects for etoricoxib and ibuprofen were similar for stiffness upon awakening, the effect of etoricoxib on night pain was significantly greater than ibuprofen $(P=0.041).$ .  \n\nPatients treated with etoricoxib or ibuprofen used significantly less acetaminophen than those receiving placebo $:P=0.003$ for etoricoxib and $P=0.029$ for ibuprofen) for the treatment of breakthrough pain. The amount of rescue acetaminophen use in the etoricoxib and ibuprofen groups was similar.  \n\n# SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY  \n\nThe incidences of 10 prespecified AEs were compared among the treatment groups (Table III). Etoricoxib and ibuprofen at the doses used in this study were generally safe and well tolerated. The percentage of patients experiencing an AE or a serious AE was similar among the three groups (Table III). The incidence of drug-related AEs in patients receiving ibuprofen was significantly greater than for patients treated with placebo ( $P=0.029)$ . The percentage of patients who discontinued due to any AE was higher in the ibuprofen group than in the placebo and etoricoxib groups but the difference was not significant. Only one serious AE (in the ibuprofen group) was considered drug-related.  \n\nThe most common drug-related AEs were epigastric discomfort, nausea, dyspepsia, and hypertension. Drugrelated epigastric discomfort occurred most frequently in the ibuprofen group $(9.4\\%$ vs $2.7\\%$ of those treated with etoricoxib and $1.8\\%$ of the placebo group; Table III) with $95\\%$ CIs for the difference between etoricoxib and ibuprofen as well as between ibuprofen and placebo that did not cross zero, consistent with the higher incidence for ibuprofen. Drug-related nausea occurred most frequently in the ibuprofen group, whereas dyspepsia was reported with similar frequency across all groups. Discontinuations due to AEs related to the digestive system or abdominal pain were similar in the placebo and ibuprofen groups and were slightly lower in the etoricoxib group. One patient in this study had a confirmed upper GI event. This patient, who was in the ibuprofen group, had a confirmed gastric ulcer that was deemed complicated due to hemorrhage. The investigator determined that this AE was probably drug-related.  \n\nThe incidence of edema-related AEs was similar for etoricoxib and ibuprofen and was the lowest for placebo although this difference was not significant (Table III). The incidence of hypertension-related AEs was significantly higher in the etoricoxib $(6.3\\%$ ; $P<0.05^{\\prime}$ and ibuprofen $(8.9\\%$ ; $P<0.005)$ groups compared with placebo $(0.9\\%$ ; Table III). However, the rate of discontinuation due to hypertension-related AEs was low and similar among the groups. One patient each in the etoricoxib and ibuprofen groups experienced CHF.  \n\nTable II Summary of results for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints over the 12-week treatment period   \n\n![](images/39cdcead8a8f2a7d6b135849f9ba8e0bf45d45a803c3129f0f1e6dbfc4e8f477.jpg)  \nNumber of patients in the MITT analysis. yLower values indicate a greater treatment effect. Where there is no baseline value, the mean on-treatment response is given.  \n\nThere were a total of five investigator-reported thrombotic CV events (all nonfatal); one deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for placebo, two cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) for etoricoxib, and an embolic stroke and DVT for ibuprofen. Of these events, three were confirmed thrombotic CV events; the DVT on placebo, one CVA on etoricoxib, and one embolic stroke on ibuprofen. None of these three thrombotic CV events was considered to be drug-related by the investigators.  \n\nLaboratory AEs were generally more frequent in the ibuprofen group than for placebo or etoricoxib. Overall laboratory AEs occurred in four $(3.7\\%)$ patients treated with placebo, seven $(3.2\\%)$ treated with etoricoxib, and 18 $(8.5\\%)$ treated with ibuprofen. Drug-related laboratory AEs occurred in $1.9\\%$ of the placebo-treated patients, $2.3\\%$ of those treated with etoricoxib, and $7.1\\%$ of the patients treated with ibuprofen. The most common laboratory AE considered drug-related by investigators was increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the incidence of which was higher in the ibuprofen group $(2.4\\%)$ than the placebo $(0.9\\%)$ and etoricoxib $(0\\%)$ groups. The next most common drug-related laboratory AEs were increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine with the highest incidence in the ibuprofen group (both $1.9\\%$ , with both of these AEs occurring in $0.5\\%$ of patients in the etoricoxib group, and in no patients in the placebo group.  \n\nThe $95\\%$ CIs for the difference between the etoricoxib and ibuprofen groups for overall laboratory AEs $95\\%$ CI: $-10.2,~-0.9)$ and drug-related laboratory AEs $95\\%$ CI: $-9.3,\\:-0.8)$ did not cross zero which is consistent with a higher incidence on ibuprofen. Discontinuations due to laboratory AEs occurred in two patients in the placebo and two patients in the ibuprofen groups. The increased incidence of laboratory AEs in the ibuprofen group was mainly due to increases of ALT, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. Decreases in hemoglobin values were rare and occurred in $0.9\\%$ , $0.0\\%$ , and $1.9\\%$ of patients in the placebo, etoricoxib, and ibuprofen groups, respectively.  \n\n# Discussion  \n\nThis study used validated clinical endpoints for the assessment of treatment efficacy in patients with OA34,35. The demographic characteristics of the patient population at baseline were similar to those of OA patients in the general population that seek treatment5,7. Consistent with other clinical studies, the results of this trial confirm the superior clinical efficacy of etoricoxib 30 mg q.d. compared with placebo21,26 and its comparable efficacy to ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg}$ daily21. Improvement of all co-primary endpoints for etoricoxib and ibuprofen was evident within 2 weeks of the initial dose of study medication and was maintained throughout the 12 weeks of active therapy.  \n\n![](images/c513467b2f687bd389383e1741923da7edca129219ddfe3df15f1b2f92ef8f17.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Co-primary endpoints evaluated $(0{-}100\\mathrm{mm}$ VAS) over 12-week period of treatment with placebo, etoricoxib 30 mg/day, or ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg/day}$ in patients with OA of the knee or hip.

In this and a similar study21, the magnitude of the treatment responses for WOMAC subscales of pain and physical function in the etoricoxib group was in the range of changes recognized to be clinically meaningful to patients with OA of the knee or hip36. The significant efficacy of etoricoxib 30 mg vs placebo across the range of efficacy domains, including pain, stiffness, and physical function, clearly demonstrates its overall clinical effectiveness for the treatment of OA. Relief of morning stiffness for patients taking etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ is indicative of its sustained efficacy over the 24-h dosing interval and consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile37.  \n\nEtoricoxib 30 mg and ibuprofen 2400 mg were both generally well tolerated in this study. The concomitant use of GPAs in this study does not allow for a rigorous comparison of GI safety and tolerability between treatments. However, the numerically lower incidence of GI AEs, despite the use of GPAs, is consistent with previous comparisons of  \n\nGI safety and tolerability of etoricoxib to traditional NSAIDs12,13,38,39.  \n\nThe occurrence of renovascular AEs was closely monitored in this study because the role of prostaglandins in the regulation of renal homeostasis is well recognized40. Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that approximately $40\\%$ of adults with OA also have hypertension, which is similar to the baseline status of the population in the present study41. In this study, the incidence of hypertension-related AEs was significantly higher for patients taking either ibuprofen or etoricoxib compared with placebo, with the highest incidence occurring in patients on ibuprofen. The incidence of edema-related AEs was similar in patients treated with etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ and ibuprofen 2400 mg and was numerically higher in patients receiving either active treatment compared with placebo. These data point out the importance of monitoring blood pressure in all patients on NSAID therapy.  \n\nThis clinical trial was not designed to assess the thrombotic CV safety of etoricoxib or ibuprofen relative to placebo. However, a large, long-term non-inferiority clinical trials program, the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term (MEDAL) Progra m42,43, designed to assess the thrombotic CV risk of etoricoxib (60 or $90\\mathsf{m g}$ relative to the traditional NSAID diclofenac $150\\mathrm{mg}$ in OA and rheumatoid arthritis patients, has recently been completed. The MEDAL Program demonstrated that rates of confirmed thrombotic CV events were comparable, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.95 $95\\%$ CI: 0.81, 1.11)43. These data help to inform the benefits and risks of treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor such as etoricoxib.  \n\nTable III Summary of AEs in 12-week study of etoricoxib and ibuprofen in patients with OA   \n\n![](images/ae597972225c36c64f1b1ebb483093b154b1a120715323a3b329d77a81f48ca9.jpg)  \n$^{\\star}P_{<}0.05$ vs placebo. $^{\\star\\star}P=0.005$ vs placebo. yDVT. $\\ddagger{\\mathsf{C V A}}$ ; CHF; and seizure/CVA. $\\S^{\\lfloor}$ Perforated appendicitis; musculoskeletal chest pain; embolic stroke; dental infection; and DVT (considered drug-related).  \n\n# Conclusion  \n\nIn this trial, treatment with etoricoxib $30\\mathsf{m g}$ q.d. for the treatment of OA is well tolerated and provides therapeutic effectiveness that is superior to placebo and comparable to ibuprofen $2400\\mathrm{mg}$ (800 mg t.i.d).  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors would like to thank Mr Anish Mehta and Dr Paul Cavanaugh of Merck Research Laboratories for their assistance with preparation of this manuscript.  \n\n# References  \n\n1.
