## Abstract

Background: Informal neighbor relationships (NRs) are considered a structural aspect of social relationships. Although NRs might affect physical activity (PA), no previous study has simultaneously examined compositional and contextual associations of NRs with PA. In this study, we examined whether individual- and community-level NRs were independently associated with PA.

Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 8592 (4340 men and 4252 women) non-disabled residents aged 65-84 years from all 18 districts of Ota City, Tokyo. PA was assessed by using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. In addition, we calculated moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), its components (vigorous PA [VPA], moderate PA [MPA], and walking time [WT]), and sitting time (ST). Individual-level NRs were categorized as "visiting each other," "standing and chatting," "exchange of greetings," or "none." Community-level NRs were defined as the proportions of residents with active NRs (i.e., those in the categories visiting each other and standing and chatting) in the 18 districts. Using multilevel regression analyses, we examined independent associations of individual- and community-level NRs with PA variables and adjusted for important confounders.

Results: Individual-level NRs were consistently positively associated with MVPA and its components (VPA, MPA [in men], and WT) in both sexes, and the dose-response relationships were significant (all P

Conclusions: Men and women with inaccessible neighbors engaged in less MVPA, while men living in communities with active NRs engaged in more MVPA, regardless of individual-level NRs. NRs at the individual and community level might help prevent physical inactivity among men.

modeling approach to simultaneously examine the com- positional and contextual effects of NRs.

In conclusion, although the compositional effects of NRs on PA were observed in both sexes, contextual effects and their cross-level interactions were observed only in men. An approach promoting NRs at both the individual and community level may therefore be im- portant, particularly for preventing physical inactivity among men.

## Background

Physical inactivity is an important contributor to non-communicable diseases and-after high blood pres- sure, tobacco use, and high blood glucose-is the fourth most important risk factor for mortality [1, 2]. Among older adults, physical activity (PA) includes recreational or leisure-time activity, transportation, occupation, household chores, play, games, sports, and planned exer- cise in the context of daily, family, and community activ- ities [1]. Regular PA helps maintain and improve physical and cognitive function among older adults [3-5]. Despite growing evidence of the health benefits of PA and the presence of established recommendations for healthy aging [1, 6], physical inactivity remains a major concern for older and younger adults [7]. Thus, attention has in- creasingly focused on public health efforts designed to in- crease PA. In Japan, a new initiative, Healthy Japan 21 (second term)-a 10-year national health promotion cam- paign to extend healthy life expectancy and reduce health disparities by establishing targets in 53 specific areas [8]- was launched in 2013 by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Increasing PA is one of its explicit goals.

Recent public health studies have examined the social connection offered by relationships, as social relation- ships can affect health behaviors such as PA [9] and out- comes such as mortality [10-12] are likely to promote healthy communities. Social relationships are broadly defined as the degree to which individuals are interconnected and embedded in communities [13] and have both structural and functional aspects. The struc- tural aspects include social integration, which refers to an individual's overall level of involvement with informal social relationships (e.g., having a spouse), formal social relationships (e.g., those with volunteer organizations), and the social network, which refers to the web of social relationships surrounding an individual, particularly those structural features such as the type and strength of each social relationship [11]. The functional aspects include social support, which refers to the support exchanged through social relationships [11]. Because these aspects of social relationships can be analyzed at the individual and group level, studies should consider them simultaneously when examining their effects on health behaviors.

A previous systematic review [9] found that people with greater social support for PA (especially when it originated from family members) were more likely to en- gage in leisure-time PA and highlighted the importance of friends as sources of support for leisure-time PA in older adults. Moreover, a previous study of Japanese older adults reported that active relationships with neighbors might ameliorate infrequent eating habits caused by limited access to food [14]. These findings suggest that informal neighbor relationships (NRs) could

affect individual health behaviors through pathways such as social support. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has simultaneously investigated the individual-level (compositional) and community-level (contextual) effects of NRs on PA.

Using data from older adults living in a metropolitan area of Japan, we examined whether individual- and community-level NRs were positively associated with PA. Specifically, we examined if each individual- and community-level NR was independently associated with PA and if observed associations differed by sex.

## Methods

## Study population

We used baseline data from a community-wide intervention study on preventing and reducing frailty in Ota City, Tokyo, Japan (Ota Genki Senior Project), which was launched in 2016 [15]. The full details of the partici- pant selection process were previously published [15]. Briefly, 15,500 residents aged 65-84 years-approximately 10% of the elderly population of Ota City-were selected by using stratified and random sampling strat- egies in all 18 districts. All participants were physically and cognitively independent, which was defined as absence of long-term care insurance certification.

Of the 15,500 self-administered questionnaires distributed in July 2016, 11,925 were returned (response rate, 76.9%) [15]. After excluding 79 questionnaires from respondents who did not actually live in Ota City, 38 questionnaires that were mostly or completely blank, 19 questionnaires with missing identification labels, 22 questionnaires that were completed by someone other than the participant, 66 questionnaires from hospital inpatients and nursing home residents, and 3109 questionnaires with missing information on PA and/or NRs, a total of 8592 questionnaires (4340 men and 4252 women) were ultimately included in our analysis (Fig. 1). The mean district response rate was 77.1% (range, 71.8- 80.8%, and the number of respondents per district was 255 to 2135 (mean, 477).

## Measurements

## PA

PA was evaluated with the Japanese version of the Inter- national Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the external reliability and validity of which have been reported [16, 17]. The IPAQ-SF includes separate items on time spent on vigorous PA (VPA), moderate PA (MPA), walking time (WT), and sitting time (ST) during a typical week. Using these values, we defined total moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as 7 days × (8.0 metabolic equivalents [METs] × VPA hours/day + 4.0 METs × MPA hours/day + 3.3 METs × walking hours/

walking one-quarter of a mile (0.4 km) or climbing 10 steps without resting [21]. Depressive mood was evaluated with the five-item short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (range, 0-5) [22], and the presence of depression was defined as a score of 2 or greater. Participation in any of the following activities more than once a month was defined as presence of social activity: volunteering, civic action, nonprofit organizations, sports groups, hobby and learning groups, senior citizen clubs, neighborhood associations, or others, but excluding employment. If participants did not respond to the covariates, corresponding observations were assigned to the "missing" categories.

## Statistical analyses

All data were analyzed in relation to sex by using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, TX, USA). The chi-square and unpaired t tests were used to compare individual- and community-level NRs between sexes. To examine whether PA variables were systematically associated with NRs, we used a trend test that extended the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (the "naptrend" command in Stata). The chi-square test was used for other characteristic variables. Because our data had a multilevel structure comprising individuals (at level 1) nested within 18 districts (at level 2), we performed multilevel regression analyses with fixed slopes and random intercept models adjusted for all covariates and calculated partial regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify both the individual-level (composition) and community-level (contextual) effects of NRs on PA variables. MVPA and its components (VPA, MPA, and WT) and ST were defined as the dependent variables. Individual- and community-level NRs, and their cross-level interaction terms and covariates, were defined as fixed factors. The district was defined as a random factor. A linear trend test was used to assess the dose-response relationship between NR level and PA variables. To avoid issues related to multicollinearity, community-level NRs were centered on their grand mean. An α of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

## Results

Among 4340 men, 14.9% described their NR status as visiting each other, 30.3% as standing and chatting, 44.3% as exchange of greetings, and 10.5% as none. Among the 4252 women, the responses were 29.8%, 44.6%, 22.1%, and 3.6%, respectively. Overall, women were significantly more likely than men to have active NRs at the individual level ( P

Tables 3 and 4 show associations of individual- and community-level NRs with PA variables, as determined by multilevel regression analyses after adjusting for all covariates, in men (Table 3) and women (Table 4). Among men, individual-level NRs were consistently positively associated with MVPA and its components VPA, MPA, and WT, and the dose-response relationships were significant (all P

Among women, individual-level NRs were positively associated with MVPA and its components VPA and WT, and the dose-response relationships were significant, as was the case for men (all P

The range of interclass correlation coefficients was 0.0000 to 0.0022 for PA variables in both sexes, which indicated that variances in PA variables, as explained by the random effects for districts, were extremely small (0.00-0.22%).

## Discussion

The present sex-stratified multilevel analyses revealed three main findings. First, individual-level NRs were

women to benefit from interventions that increase social networks [32] and benefited more than women from bonding social capital (i.e., resources accessed within networks or groups in which the members share similar background characteristics, such as sex) [33]. Because the present community-level unit of analysis was the district, NRs from male leaders or executives in the neighborhood associations (i.e., social support between men) could have easily directly influenced the MVPA of male inhabitants.

Our study has several limitations. First, the self-administered questionnaire used for measurement may be subject to recall bias. Although the IPAQ-SF is recommended and widely used for easy assessment of PA, it tends to overestimate reported PA, as compared with objective

devices [17]. Second, selection bias is a concern, as 3002 (approximately 25%) of the respondents were excluded because of missing IPAQ-SF items. Third, our findings were obtained by analyzing data from older adults living in a metropolitan area in Japan. Thus, differences between countries and regions (urban or rural) should be considered when extrapolating these data to other settings. Finally, the direction of causality cannot be inferred in a cross-sectional study. We plan to conduct follow-up surveys, to examine longitudinally the associations observed in this study.

Despite these limitations, this study is to our knowledge the first to report associations of NRs with MVPA and its domains among older adults. Moreover, our evidence is strengthened by the use of a multilevel
