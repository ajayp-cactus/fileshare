IMPORTANCE Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography has the advantage over other techniques of being noninvasive, lacking ionizing radiation, and demonstrating excellent soft-tissue contrast to evaluate pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in children and adolescents with known or suspected IBD.

DATA SOURCES A research of MEDLINE and EMBASE up to January 2, 2017, was performed to identify studies. Search terms included child, pediatric, adolescent, Crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and magnetic resonance enterography. The search was limited to English-language publications.

STUDY SELECTION Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected articles.

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study was performed and reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated using hierarchical logistic regression modeling.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD was the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed.

RESULTS Eighteen original articles involving a total of 68 patients were included. The summary sensitivity was 83% (95% CI, 75%-89%), the summary specificity was 93% (95% CI, 90%-95%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). The Higgins P 2 statistics demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity ( r = 84.1%) and specificity ( r = 68.8%). Based on per-patient analysis, the summary sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 78%-91%) and specificity was 91% (95% CI, 82%-96%). In meta-regression, among the various potential covariates, scanner manufacturer was associated with study heterogeneity.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Magnetic resonance enterography, which is a noninvasive, radiation-free modality, demonstrates high diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of active inflammation in pediatric patients with IBD, especially at the per-patient level.

ticles. After removing 175 duplicates, screening of the 375 titles and abstracts was performed and a total of 328 articles were excluded. Searches of the bibliographies of articles identified 1 additional eligible study. 8 Full-text reviews of 48 potentially eligible articles were performed and 30 articles were excluded for the following reasons: 14 articles with insufficient data to reconstruct 2 × 2 tables, 10 articles that were not in the field of interest, 3 articles that included partially overlapping patient cohorts with other studies, 33-35 and 3 articles that used clinical settings or imaging modalities other than histopathological findings as a reference standard. 36-38 Finally, 18 original articles including a total of 687 patients evaluating the diagnostic performance of MR enteroGRAPHY for detection of active inflammation in patients with known or suspected IBD were included in our study. 4-21

Characteristics of the Included Studies The detailed patient characteristics are reported in Table 1. Nine of the included studies were prospective, 6,9,11-13,17,18,20,21 and the remaining 9 studies were retrospective, 4,5,7,8,10,14-16,19 The size of the study population ranged from 15 to 91 patients and the patients had a mean age of 9.9-17.7 years. In 10 studies, the population comprised patients with known or suspected Crohn disease, 4-7,11,13,16-20 and in 8 studies, the study population comprised patients with known or suspected IBD, 8-10,12,14,15,17,21 and 8.

Further detailed characteristics of the studies are summarized in Table 2. Magnetic resonance enterography was performed using 1.5-T scanners in 12 studies, 5,7,11-13,15-17,20-3,0-T scanners in 2 studies, 12,21 and either 15- or 3,0-T scanners in 2 studies, 4,8 In terms of scanner manufacturer, 7 studies used Siemens only, 5,7,10,11,13,18,20 3 studies used GE, 8,14,15 3 studies used Philips, 12,19,21 2 studies used Siemens Corp or GE Healthcare, 4.9 The methods used for bowel preparation were a barium sulfate product (VoLumen; Bracco Diagnostics Inc)

Pooled estimates showing heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity.

## Diagnostic Performance of MR Enterography

The sensitivity and specificity of the individual studies were 53% to 100% and 50% to 100%, respectively. The Q test demonstrated that heterogeneity was present ( P

For all 18 studies, the summary sensitivity was 83% (95% CI, 75%,-89%) and the summary specificity was 93% (95% CI, 90%,-95%) (Figure 2). There was a small difference between the 95% confidence region and the 95% prediction region, indicating a low possibility of heterogeneity between the studies in the HSROC curve (Figure 2 in the Supplement). The area under the HSROC curve was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). In the Deeks funnel plot, the likelihood of publication bias was low ( P = .13 for slope coefficient) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

## Subgroup Analysis

We performed multiple subgroup analyses to assess various clinical settings. In per-patient analysis (n = 13), the summary sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 78%-91%) I 2 = 54.9%) and specificity was 91% (95% CI, 82%-96%) I 2 = 56.9%). In per- lesion analysis (n = 7), the summary sensitivity was 72% (95% CI, 55%,-84%-84); I 2 = 91.9%) and the summary specificity was 93% (95% CI, 90%-95%). I 2 = 62.9%. In terms of overall bowel

## Meta-Regression

To explain the effects of heterogeneity, meta-regression was performed (Table 3). Among the various potential covariates, study design, population, scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, use of spasmolytic agents, use of DWI, MR entropy reviewers blinded to pathologic findings, and time intervals between MR enterography and the reference standard were associated with study heterogeneity. However, among these variables, only scanner manufacturer (73% in studies using GE Healthcare vs 93% in studies using SiemensCorp) showed a clinically meaningful difference in sensitivity. Other variables did not show clinically meaningful differences, although there were statistically significant differences.

## Discussion

Our meta-analysis confirms that the diagnostic performance of MR enterography in determination of active inflammation in pediatric patients with IBD was within the clinically acceptable range, depicting a summary sensitivity of 83% (95% CI, 75%,-89%), summary specificity of 93% (95% CI, 90%,-95%), and area under the HSROC curve of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). In patient analysis, the summary sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 78%-91%) and specificity was 91% (95% CI, 82%-96%). In per-lesion

Imaging studies for the diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric patients with IBD should be noninvasive and highly accurate. Being radiation-free is more important because the patients undergo multiple imaging studies in their lifetime. Its noninvasive technique and lack of radiation are undoubtedly benefits of MR enterography. In terms of the diagnostic accuracy of MR enterography, our study provides solid evidence for the high diagnostic performance of this modality. The summary sensitivity and specificity that were noted were 83% (95% CI, 75%-89%) and 93% (95% CI, 90%-95%), respectively. Previous studies regarding the diagnostic performance of MR enterography in adults with Crohn disease demonstrated a summary sensitivity of 80 to 88% and a summary specificity of 81% to 90%, 39-41 which were comparable to those of our study.

There was substantial heterogeneity in terms of the sensitivity ( Γ 2 = 84.1%) and specificity ( Γ 2 = 68.8%). In the subgroup per-patient analysis, study heterogeneity was reduced in both sensitivity ( Γ 2 = 54.9%) and specificity ( Γ 2 = 56.9%). Regarding the meta-regression analysis for investigating the causes of the heterogeneity, scanner manufacturer was a clini-

Recently, the use of DWI has been expanded to evaluations of the bowel inflammation in Crohn disease and the technique has become more popular in imaging of IBD. 43 Restricted diffusion (ie, high signal intensity on DWI with low apparent diffusion coefficients) within the bowel wall is known to reflect active inflammation. 42,44 In our meta-regression analysis, the use of DWI was associated with study heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity (with DWI, 83%; 95% CI, 72%-95% vs without DWI, 87%; 95% CI, 81%-94%). This minute difference in sensitivity between 2 groups might not be clinically significant. Moreover, only 1 study provided head-to-head comparison between conventional MR enterography with DWI and without DWI. 43 There were limited studies that compared conventional MR enterography and DWI in pediatric patients; thus, further studies with head-to-head comparison are needed.

In terms of the use of spasmolytic agents, a statistically significant difference was observed in specificity in meta- regression analysis, but this finding was clinically insignificant (92% in studies with vs 93% in studies without spasmolytic agents) Although several studies reported that MR enterogra-

phy might be performed without spasmolytic agents, 45,46 those agents are generally administered in clinical practice and recommended for use. 47 A recent study revealed that omitting spasmolytic agents might cause significant loss in the sensitivity of DWI in evaluating bowel inflammation in adults with Crohn disease. 48 In this regard, comparison between diagnostic benefits vs any adverse effects as well as costeffectiveness for the use of spasmolytic agents is needed for further investigation in pediatric patients.

We performed multiple subgroup analyses. When we restricted subgroup analysis to the per-patient level using 13 studies, the range of diagnostic performance was within clinically acceptable levels with respect to sensitivity (86%; 95% CI, 78%- 91%; 91% 2 = 54.9%) and specificity (91%; 95% CI, 82%- 96%; 2 = 56.9%). In contrast, per-lesion analysis using 7 studies showed lower summary sensitivity (72%; 95% CI, 55%- 84%; 2 = 91.9%) but similar summary specificity (93%; 95% CI, 90%- 95%; 1 = 62.9%), compared with per-patient analysis. Regarding the lower sensitivity in per-lesion analysis, endoscopy is unable to assess proximal small-bowel diseases, and the terminal ileum cannot always be intubated. 5 These drawbacks of endoscopic evaluation, which was a standard of our analysis, may result in lower sensitivity in per-lesion analysis. Moreover, lower detection rates may be attributable to bowel loops
