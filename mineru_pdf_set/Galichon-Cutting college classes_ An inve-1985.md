The purpose of this study was to develop a profile of the undergraduate student who is “illegally' absent from class. Illegal absences were defined as those due to reasons other than illness or personal/family crises.  \n\nThis study was conducted at a major universityin themetropolitanNewYork area. The university's full-time undergraduate enrollment is 10,000 students, of which approximately $6{,}000$ are male. Three hundred questionnaires were distributed about the campus at various times and places.  \n\nThe questionnaire consisted of our parts. In the first part, respondents were presented with nine statements reflecting various  attitudes towards education, grades, attendance, study habits, socializing, drinking, and drugs. Subjects were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree/disagree (\"strongly agree\" $=1\\ldots$ \"strongly disagree\" $=5$ ）with each statement.  \n\nThe second part was concerned with the importance of various factors which would cause a student to intentionally miss a class. Students rated each factor on a 4-point scale ranging from “extremely important\" (1） to “not important\"(4). These factors included outside employment, extracurricular activities, disinterest in the class, importance of the class to career, dislike of professor, having easy access to another student's notes, staying out late the night before, use of alcohol, marijuana or drugs, and thc weather.  \n\nThe third part attempted to measure the number ${\\bf\\nabla}.\\bf{Q}^{f}$ illegal class absences per typical month. The response categories were 0,1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16,17-20, and $^{21+}$ .This Question served as the secondvariableineachofthecorrelations. This section also attempted to measure the quality of alcohol, marijuana, and drugs consumed in a typical month.  \n\nThe last part consisted of various demographic questions including, sex, class, and grade point average.  \n\n![](images/37b8f8a75b07bf8ac406d0fc45d3d00ab09c13b23f31c176438d9a1ea7072b70.jpg)  \njunor juapnis aballo ·(00 = u) az!s   \n1 .  \n\nTABLE2 Importance of Various Factors in the Decision to Cut A Class   \n\n![](images/cfc0c46ed01580c19bf13f911d575f66a1440eb971e03df7830e70e33f4c2ad3.jpg)  \nNote: $1=$ Extremely Important, $2=$ Important, $3=$ Slightly Important, $4=$ Not Important  \n\nfrequently bclieved that they tend to leave things to the last minute rather than pace their study habits. These students also placed less importance on the achievement of good grades, enjoyed smoking marijuana, felt that college is less important to their future career and had a lesser interest in school organizations. It should be noted, however, that although  thc  correlations are  statistically significant, many may have little practical importance because of their low magnitude.  \n\nRegarding the importance cf various factors listed in part 2 of the questionnairc, beautiful weather, fnding the class boring, and dislike for the professor or class corrclate most strongly with number of illegal class absences. These are follcwed by having access to missed notes, finding the class of no use to future careers, drinking  alcohol, and  bad weather. Following these are being out late the night before, taking drugs, outside employment, and smoking marijuana.  \n\nTable 2, based on the mean and median responses of all 300 subjects to part 2 of the questionnaire, indicates that the most important factors in causing one to cut a class are finding the class boring, outside employment, dislike for the professor, finding the class of no use in future careers, beautiful weather, and dislike of the class. The means for the above factors on importance ranged between 2.39 and 3.53. The least important factors were drinking alcoholic beverages, smoking marijuana, and using drugs (means ranging from 3.30 to 3.70). These results are consistent with the results obtained from studying the -torrelations.  \n\nWith respect to parts 3 and 4 of the questionnaire, Table 1 indicates that the quantities of alcohol, marijuana, and drugs consumed were significantly larger for those students who cut classes more often. Also, there was an inverse corrclation between grade point average and number of illegal absences. As expected.  \n\nthe more a student cuts class, the poorer the academic performance.  \n\nIt is interesting to note that there was no significant difference in number of cuts between the sexes or among the classes. In addition, the day most likely to be cut was a Friday.  \n\nto socialize with peers, yet have less interest in school organizations; they are likely to have a higher consumption of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. The major reasons for cutting class were \"beautiful weather,” “\"finding the class boring,\" “disliking the professor,\" and \"disliking the class.\"  \n\n# Conclusion  \n\nThe profile of students who cut classes often appears to be the following: They find education to be of little importance to their future career; they have a need  \n\nThis study was exploratory in nature; it only dealt with students from one major university. Future research should use a probability sample of colleges and universities throughout the United States.  \n\nPeter G. Northouse, and Laurel L. Northouse (1985). Health Commumication. A Handbook for Health Professionals. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc. The book is written from a dual perspective of nursing and communication. The author seeks to describe how communication functions in health care settings. Emphasis is placed on such factors as: empathy, control, selfdisclosure, trust, and confirmation in health care.Such communication must of necessityinvolve professional-professional, professional-client, professional-family, and family-client personnel. The following major points are involved: (1) shows how concepts of communications can be applied directly to thecomplex problems that occur in health care settings, (2) cites recent and relevant research findings that are indispensable to understanding human interaction in health care, (3) discusses interviewing, nonverbal communication, small group communication, and conflict resolution, (4） includes an extensive bibliography, (5） contains 79 tables and figures, and (6) concludes each chapter with a summary.  \n\nInt educatin cuts an ing the govern Warren sultof univers process as for Assessin pecially graphic takep This de about petition the rise and Sm scarce f Adminis faculty, and to tional ef Altha to St Geras the  \n\nGraham Wootton (1985). Interest Groups: Policy and Politics in America. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc. The author maintains that this is a teaching book in more senses than one. It provides a substantial amount of basic information about the whole range of interest groups that concern themselves with national domestic policy. It also contains basic information about the methods and techniques used by groups in pursuing their objectives. It starts with the concrele and proceeds to the abstract or conceptual, drawing on stimulating and even provocative statements that gradually receive the proper qualification. It seeks to develop “critical awareness\" among readers. The author maintains that social power needs to be differentiated from the political order. The significance of election results on interest group achievements suggest that the individual can not do too much to change one's situation, only the big lobbies can do it.\" A subject suggested for debate is “We don't have a democracy of the people now. We have a special-interest democracy. The individual has no way of appealing to the government. The true democracy is where the individual is able to affect his own situation. That is not true in this country anymore, only the big lobbies can do it. Chapter 4 deals with “\"The constitution,\" and Chapter 5 deals with “Congress\" Part IlI, for example, deals with “Groups andpublicpolicy.\"  "}
