Search terms included child, pediatric, adolescent, Crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and magnetic resonance enterography. The search was limited to English-language publications.  \n\nSTUDY SELECTION Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected articles.  \n\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study was performed and reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated using hierarchical logistic regression modeling.  \n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD was the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed.  \n\nRESULTS Eighteen original articles involving a total of 687 patients were included. The summary sensitivity was $83\\%$ $95\\%$ CI, $75\\%-89\\%$ ), the summary specificity was $93\\%$ $95\\%$ CI, $90\\%-95\\%$ ), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.95 ( $95\\%$ CI, 0.93-0.97). The Higgins $I^{2}$ statistics demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity $(I^{2}=84.1\\%)$ ) and specificity $(I^{2}=68.8\\%)$ . Based on per-patient analysis, the summary sensitivity was $86\\%$ ( $95\\%$ CI, $78\\%-91\\%$ ) and specificity was $91\\%$ $95\\%$ CI, $82\\%.96\\%$ ). In meta-regression, among the various potential covariates, scanner manufacturer was associated with study heterogeneity.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Magnetic resonance enterography, which is a noninvasive, radiation-free modality, demonstrates high diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of active inflammation in pediatric patients with IBD, especially at the per-patient level.  \n\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea (Yoon, J.

Modalities for bowel imaging include a small-bowel follow-through, abdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomographic (CT) enterography, and capsule endoscopy. However, the small-bowel followthrough has low sensitivity for detection of the involved bowel segment, and significant exposure to ionizing radiation is the major drawback of this study.2 Abdominal US is a noninvasive and radiation-free imaging modality; however, it does not allow for whole-bowel imaging and depends on the operatorâ€™s experience. In addition, a recent study reported that abdominal US had moderate interrater agreement and low agreement with MR enterography, especially in mid- and proximal smallbowel imaging.3 Computed tomographic enterography can objectively demonstrate mural as well as extraintestinal diseases; however, careful consideration should be given when performing CT enterography owing to radiation exposure. Capsule endoscopy can directly visualize the small bowel, but evaluation of extraintestinal disease is impossible and capsule retention, which necessitates surgical exploration, may occur in patients who have substantial luminal narrowing.  \n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) enterography has rapidly emerged as the diagnostic imaging modality of choice to identify disease involvement and assess disease activity.4-21 Magnetic resonance enterography has the advantage of being noninvasive, lacking ionizing radiation, and demonstrating excellent soft-tissue contrast. Because children are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and they have to undergo multiple imaging studies during their lifetime to monitor disease activity, MR enterography is the best radiologic imaging modality in the field of pediatric IBD.22  \n\nAs interest in MR enterography grows, there are multiple studies that evaluated the diagnostic performance of MR enterography in pediatric patients. However, to our knowledge, the diagnostic performance of MR enterography in that population has not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, factors affecting the diagnostic performance should be identified if heterogeneity exists. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation using histopathology as the reference standard in children and adolescents with known or suspected IBD.  \n\n# Methods  \n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was performed and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.23 This study was approved by Asan Medical Center.  \n\n# Literature Search  \n\nA search of MEDLINE and EMBASE up to January 2, 2017, was performed to identify studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflam  \n\n# Key Points  \n\nQuestion What is the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance enterography, which is a noninvasive and radiation-free technique, for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease?  \n\nFindings In this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 18 original articles involving 687 patients, the summary sensitivity was $83\\%$ and the summary specificity was $93\\%$ . Based on per-patient analysis, the summary sensitivity was $86\\%$ and specificity was $91\\%$ .  \n\nMeaning Magnetic resonance enterography demonstrates high diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease, especially at the per-patient level.  \n\nmation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD. The search terms combined synonyms for children, Crohn disease or IBD, and MR enterography as follows: ([child\\*] or [pediatric\\*] or [pediatric\\*] or [adolescent\\*]) and ([Crohn\\*] or [inflammatory bowel disease] or [IBD]) and ([magnetic resonance enterography] or [MR enterography] or [MRE] or [MR-E]). Bibliographies of identified studies were also screened to expand the extent of search. Our search was limited to English-language publications.  \n\n# Inclusion Criteria  \n\nStudies or subsets of studies were included if they satisfied all of the following criteria: (1) involved pediatric patients who underwent MR enterography for known or suspected IBD, (2) included reference standards based on histopathologic test findings, and (3) contained results published in sufficient detail for reconstruction of $2\\times2$ tables for determination of the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation.  \n\n# Exclusion Criteria  \n\nStudies were excluded if any of following criteria were met: (1) case reports or case series involving fewer than 10 patients; (2) conference abstracts, letters, editorials, reviews, meta-analyses, consensus statements, and guidelines; (3) studies focusing on topics other than the use of MR enterography to diagnose active inflammation; (4) studies with partially overlapping patient populations; and (5) studies using clinical setting or other imaging modalities as a reference standard. Two of us (H.M.Y., with 4 years of experience in pediatric radiology, and C.H.S., with 4 years of experience performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses) independently assessed the eligibility of the articles selected from the literature.  \n\n# Data Extraction and Quality Assessment  \n\nWe extracted the following data on study design and results from the included studies using a standardized form: (1) study characteristics (authors, year of publication, affiliation, country of origin, duration of patient recruitment, and study design), (2) demographic and clinical characteristics (sample size, male to female ratio, patient age, and study population), (3) technical characteristics of MR enterography (scanner manufacturer and model, magnetic field strength, bowel preparation, spasmolytic agents, and specific sequences used), (4) MR enterography interpretation (number of reviewers, experience, and blinding to clinicopathologic findings), (5) time intervals between MR enterography and the reference standard, and (6) diagnostic performance of MR enterography (type of analysis and bowel location).  \n\nThe methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated using tailored questionnaires and criteria by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2).24 Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 of us (H.M.Y. and C.H.S.).  \n\n# Data Synthesis and Analysis  \n\nThe diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD was the primary outcome for our metaanalysis. Heterogeneity was determined using the inconsistency index $(I^{2})$ as follows: $0\\%$ to $40\\%$ , might not be important; $30\\%$ to $60\\%$ , moderate heterogeneity; $50\\%$ to $90\\%$ , substantial heterogeneity; and $75\\%$ to $100\\%$ , considerable heterogeneity. The threshold effect was analyzed by visual assessment of the coupled forest plots of sensitivity and specificity. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the sensitivity and false-positive rates greater than 0.6 was assessed to indicate a considerable threshold effect.26  \n\nThepooledsensitivityandspecificityandtheir $95\\%$ CIswere calculated using the bivariate random-effects model.27-31 For graphicpresentationofthestudyresults,ahierarchicalsummary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve with a $95\\%$ confidenceregionandpredictionregionwasplotted.Publicationbias was assessed using the Deeks funnel plot, and statistical significance was determined with the Deeks asymmetry test.32  \n\nWe performed subgroup analyses to assess various clinical settings: (1) per-patient analysis, (2) per-lesion analysis, and (3) assessment of overall bowel segments for all studies. We also performed meta-regression to explain the effects of heterogeneity. The following covariates were considered for the bivariate model: (1) study design (prospective vs retrospective), (2) population (Crohn disease vs IBD), (3) scanner manufacturer (GE vs Philips, GE vs Siemens, and Siemens vs Philips), (4) magnetic field strength of MR (3.0 vs 1.5 T), (5) use of spasmolytic agents, (6) use of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), (7) MR enterographyreviewersblindedtopathologictestfindings,(8)time intervals between MR enterography and the reference standard (â‰¤1 month vs ${>}1$ month), and (9) bowel location (overall vs small bowel). P values $<.05$ were considered as having statistical significance.ThemetandiandmidasmodulesinStata,version10.0 (StataCorpLP)andR,version3.2.3(RFoundation)withthemada module were used for statistical analyses.  \n\n# Results  \n\n# Literature Search  \n\nOur detailed study selection process is described in Figure 1. The systematic literature search initially identified 550 articles. After removing 175 duplicates, screening of the 375 titles and abstracts was performed and a total of 328 articles were excluded. Searches of the bibliographies of articles identified 1 additional eligible study.8 Full-text reviews of 48 potentially eligible articles were performed and 30 articles were excluded for the following reasons: 14 articles with insufficient data to reconstruct $2\\times2$ tables, 10 articles that were not in the field of interest, 3 articles that included partially overlapping patient cohorts with other studies,33-35 and 3 articles that used clinical settings or imaging modalities other than histopathological findings as a reference standard.36-38 Finally, 18 original articles including a total of 687 patients evaluating the diagnostic performance of MR enterography for detection of active inflammation in patients with known or suspected IBD were included in our study.4-21  \n\n![](images/b40cea90c6a68bc8d055dcb5a5e7fe501ef695b18ee8980e2cfcfcf3a8d50938.jpg)  \nFigure 1.

The Higgins $I^{2}$ statistic demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity $(I^{2}=84.1\\%)$ and specificity $(I^{2}=68.8\\%)$ ). The coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity revealed the lack of a threshold effect (Figure 2).

There was substantial heterogeneity across the studies and scanner manufacturer was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful cause of heterogeneity in meta-regression analysis. Based on our results, MR enterography, which is a noninvasive and radiation-free modality, demonstrates high diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of active inflammation in pediatric patients with IBD, especially at the per-patient level.  \n\nTable 3. Results of Meta-Regression of MR Enterography for Detection of Active Inflammation   \n\n![](images/23dd3acd80d7d90bcf9b48e47776082c778762da42b1d962d3fd66a2c2665ed5.jpg)  \nAbbreviations: DWI, diffusion-weighted imaging; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease.  \n\nImaging studies for the diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric patients with IBD should be noninvasive and highly accurate. Being radiation-free is more important because the patients undergo multiple imaging studies in their lifetime. Its noninvasive technique and lack of radiation are undoubtedly benefits of MR enterography. In terms of the diagnostic accuracy of MR enterography, our study provides solid evidence for the high diagnostic performance of this modality. The summary sensitivity and specificity that we noted were $83\\%$ $95\\%$ CI, $75\\%-89\\%$ ) and $93\\%$ $95\\%$ CI, $90\\%-95\\%;$ ), respectively. Previous studies regarding the diagnostic performance of MR enterography in adults with Crohn disease demonstrated a summary sensitivity of $80\\%$ to $88\\%$ and a summary specificity of $81\\%$ to $90\\%$ ,39-41 which were comparable to those of our study.  \n\nThere was substantial heterogeneity in terms of the sensitivity $(I^{2}=84.1\\%)$ ) and specificity $(I^{2}=68.8\\%)$ . In the subgroup per-patient analysis, study heterogeneity was reduced in both sensitivity $(I^{2}=54.9\\%)$ ) and specificity $(I^{2}=56.9\\%)$ ). Regarding the meta-regression analysis for investigating the causes of the heterogeneity, scanner manufacturer was a clinically meaningful factor affecting study heterogeneity in our study. However, 7 studies used Siemens Corp products only,5,7,10,11,13,18,20 3 studies used GE Healthcare products,8,14,15 3 studies used Philips,12,19,21 and 2 studies used Siemens Corp or GE Healthcare equipment.4,9 Owing to the paucity of the studies, caution is needed when interpreting this result.  \n\nPulse sequences in pediatric MR enterography presently are recommended to include T2-weighted images, DWI, and dynamic precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted images.42 Recently, the use of DWI has been expanded to evaluations of the bowel inflammation in Crohn disease and the technique has become more popular in imaging of IBD. Restricted diffusion (ie, high signal intensity on DWI with low apparent diffusion coefficients) within the bowel wall is known to reflect active inflammation.42,44 In our meta-regression analysis, the use of DWI was associated with study heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity (with DWI, $83\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $72\\%-95\\%$ vs without DWI, $87\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $81\\%{-}94\\%_{\\cdot}$ ). This minute difference in sensitivity between 2 groups might not be clinically significant. Moreover, only 1 study provided head-to-head comparison between conventional MR enterography with DWI and without DWI.4 There were limited studies that compared conventional MR enterography and DWI in pediatric patients; thus, further studies with head-to-head comparison are needed.  \n\nIn terms of the use of spasmolytic agents, a statistically significant difference was observed in specificity in metaregression analysis, but this finding was clinically insignificant $92\\%$ in studies with vs $93\\%$ in studies without spasmolytic agents) Although several studies reported that MR enterography might be performed without spasmolytic agents,45,46 those agents are generally administered in clinical practice and recommended for use.47 A recent study revealed that omitting spasmolytic agents might cause significant loss in the sensitivity of DWI in evaluating bowel inflammation in adults with Crohn disease.48 In this regard, comparison between diagnostic benefits vs any adverse effects as well as costeffectiveness for the use of spasmolytic agents is needed for further investigation in pediatric patients.  \n\nWe performed multiple subgroup analyses. When we restricted subgroup analysis to the per-patient level using 13 studies, the range of diagnostic performance was within clinically acceptable levels with respect to sensitivity $86\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $78\\%$ - $91\\%$ ; $I^{2}=54.9\\%;$ ) and specificity $91\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $82\\%-96\\%$ ; $I^{2}=56.9\\%;$ ). In contrast, per-lesion analysis using 7 studies showed lower summary sensitivity $(72\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $55\\%{-}84\\%$ ; $I^{2}=91.9\\%^{*}$ ) but similar summary specificity ( $93\\%$ ; $95\\%$ CI, $90\\%$ - $95\\%$ $.I^{2}=62.9\\%)$ ), compared with per-patient analysis. Regarding the lower sensitivity in per-lesion analysis, endoscopy is unable to assess proximal small-bowel diseases, and the terminal ileum cannot always be intubated. These drawbacks of endoscopic evaluation, which was a standard of our analysis, may result in lower sensitivity in per-lesion analysis. Moreover, lower detection rates may be attributable to bowel loops with inadequate fluid distention, particularly in the colorectum and jejunum.  \n\n# Limitations  \n\nThere were some limitations in our study. First, the heterogeneity was substantial. To overcome this heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression and multiple subgroup analyses. We found several factors associated with the heterogeneity; however, some factors remain unexplained. However, we applied solid and robust methodology for the systematic review and meta-analysis using the guidelines published by the Cochrane Collaboration.49 Second, 9 of 18 studies were retrospective, resulting in a high risk of bias in patient selection.  \n\n# Conclusions  \n\nMagnetic resonance enterography, which is a noninvasive and radiation-free modality, demonstrates high diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of active inflammation in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD, especially at the perpatient level. We hope that our study might be evidence of justification for the application of MR enterography in this population.  \n\n# ARTICLE INFORMATION  \n\nAccepted for Publication: July 8, 2017.
