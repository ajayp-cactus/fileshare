Quantum chemical calculations were performed to determine the open-circuit photovoltage $(\\mathrm{V_{OC}})$ , and to quantify the parameters such as the light harvesting efficiency, the electron injection efficiency associated with the short-circuit photocurrent density $\\mathrm{(J_{SC})}$ .All the dyes showed absorbance in visible region $\\left\\langle502.521\\mathrm{nm}\\right\\rangle$ with high oscillator strength $(f)$ (0.473-0.961) and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) (0.663-0.891). After binding to titanium oxide, all dye showed slightly redshifted absorption (521-527 nm) with improved oscillator strength $(f)$ (0.573-0.991) and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) (0.733-0.898). There is high probability that these dyes will showlarger JSC due to high driving force for electron injection. These dyes also showed high $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$ (1.037-1.128eV).These results indicate that heterocyclic azo dyes will show better light to power conversion efficiency in DSSCsdue high $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ and $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}.$ .These theoretical criteria would be useful to design and fast screen other organic dyes, specificallyfor chemically fairly similar dyes.  \n\nKeywords: Organic dyes, Dye sensitized solar cells, heterocyclic azo dyes, Density functional theory, efficiency.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nDye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gotten increasing attention as potential alternatives due to their efficient conversion of solar energy to electricity at a low cost[1-4]. In past two decades different photosensitizers have been designed and applied to DSSCs [5, 6]. Ruthenium complexes showed overall conversion efficiency over $11\\%$ [7]. But their application is limited due to high cost, limited reserves of ruthenium and environmental risk. Organic sensitizers, e.g. triphenylamine derivatives [8-10], azo dyes [11], hydrazones[12] etc. have been extensively studied due to their unique advantages, such as low-cost, environmental friendly and tunable properties[13-15].  \n\nExtensive work has done for the designing of high efficiency metal-free organic dyes for DSSCs.The  novel  designed  dyes  with  the  donor-bridge-acceptor $(\\mathbf{D}{-}\\pi{-}\\mathbf{A})$ system  can usually  achieve  an  efficient  photovoltaic  performance.   Dyes  play  an  important  rolein gaining  higher  solar-to-electricity  conversion  efficiency  becausethe  performance  of  DSSCs strongly  depends  on  the  following  factorswhich  are  the  criteria  for  a  good  dye  sensitizer: (i)  Wide  absorptionwavelength  in  visible  to  near  infrared  (IR)  region;  (ii)  Easy electroninjection  from  the  excited  state  of  the  dyes  to  the  conduction  bandof $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and (iii)  Good  electron  transfer  from  the  donor  to  acceptor.  All  these  factors  are  closely associated  with  the  ground  andexcited  electronic  states  of  the  dye  sensitizer.  \n\nThe bathochromic shift of the absorption maxima is one ofthe most important challenges to improve the DSSCs performance. Snaith proposed that with the loss-in-potential of thepresent state-of-the-art DSSCs (0.75 eV), a maximum efficiency of1 $3.4\\%$ is achievable employing a sensitizer with an absorptiononset at $840\\mathrm{nm}[16]$ .Reducing the loss-in-potential to that of the least ‘‘lossy’’ DSSC reported to date $(0.66~\\mathrm{eV})$ results in a maximum efficiency of $15.1\\%$ with an absorption onset a $\\mathfrak{u t}920\\mathrm{nm}[17]$ . The first issue could be fulfilled by the introductionof electron-donating groups onto the donors, introduction ofelectron-rich and electron-withdrawing groups onto the $\\pi$ -bridges,or incorporation of a longer conjugated segment in the push– pullsystem.  Therefore, choosing a suitable donor group inthe D–π–A system is very critical to balance between photo-voltage, driving forces and spectral response for the preparation ofhigh efficiency dyes[18].  \n\nBut every time enhancing the efficiency of the dyes by simple expansion of the $\\pi$ -conjugated system through increasing the number of electron-rich segments (such as thiophene) was not an effective strategy, because the halogen bonding between iodine and some electron-rich segments of the dye molecules could cause a larger charge recombination rate at the titania/electrolyte interface.  \n\nComputational chemistry has emerged in the past 20 years as one of the most powerful tools for generating highly accurate models of molecular systems and materials. The development of dye sensitized solar cells has been accompanied by computational chemistry studies that helped to rationalize the relationship between the chemical structure and device performance. In particular, electronic and optical absorption properties of dye molecules, both isolated and adsorbed on the semiconductor $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)$ surfaces, have been extensively studied using density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT, in order to help identify dyes with broad adsorption spectra and favorable electron transfer from the photoexcited dye to the semiconductor [19].  \n\nHeterocyclic azo dyes have been widely investigated mostly due to their application for coloring textiles andplastics. Thiophene, pyrrole and azoles bearing azo dyes have been used for electronic applicationssuch as optical switching, second harmonic generationand organic sensitized solar cells [20, 21]. Over the past decade, there has been a number of articles and patents detailing the use of azo dyes as sensors[22]. Azo dyes combine their optical and electronic properties with good chemical stability and solution processability [23],which makes them interesting for DSSC applications. Nevertheless, thereis smallnumber of reports on DSSCs with azo dyes as sensitizers [21].  \n\nWith the aim to shed light on the electro-optical and charge transport properties in azo sensitizers, we have performed this study. In the best of our knowledge, no detailed computational study has been performed about the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs), lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), absorption wavelengths, electron injection and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of our adopted azo dyes and dyes $\\textstyle{\\mathcal{@}}\\operatorname{TiO}_{2}$ cluster.Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods are used calculatethe above mentioned properties of interests. Open-circuit photovoltage $(\\mathrm{V_{OC}})$ and key parameters controllingshort-circuit current density $(\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC}})$ were also calculated. The effect of dye adsorption on the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ cluster has been studied with respect to the distribution patterns of the frontier molecular orbitals, oscillator strengths and excitation energies.  \n\n# 2. Computational details  \n\nAll the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package [24]. The structure optimization of the ground state of the dyes in gas phase have performed by using B3LYP functional[25] and $6{\\cdot}31{+}\\mathrm{G}^{\\ast}$ basis set [26]. A tight SCF convergence criteria ( $\\mathrm{(10^{-8}a.u.)}$ and integration grid of ${10}^{\\ensuremath{-}8}$ were used for all calculations. Frequency calculations have been performed on the optimized geometry to verify the nature of the computed geometries. The lack of imaginary values in the wave numbers calculations indicated the successful geometry optimization.  \n\nFor a reasonable computational effort, the state of the art DFT/TDDFT computational methodologies  provide  reasonable  results  and  reproduce  well  the  optical  properties  of various organic dyes [27-30]. We first examined the effect of the functionals and basis set on $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$ of reference dye. Table 1 presents a comparison between simulated and experimental $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$ of reference dye[31]. Table 1 depicts that CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G\\* is best methodology that produced result comparable to experimental value. This methodology is used tosimulate the UV/Vis spectra of designed dyes.  \n\nCoulomb-attenuating method CAM-B3LYP functional[32]taking long-range correction into account, which has been proven to be appropriate for charge transfer (CT) type excitations[33- 35], was chosen tocalculate the excitation energies and the oscillator strengths.Solvent effect (acetone) was undertaken using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) with UAHF radii[36]. $\\mathrm{Ti}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{20}\\mathrm{H}_{22}$ cluster was optimized in gas phase using B3LYP functional and 6- $31{+}\\mathrm{G}^{\\ast}$ basis set for non-metal atoms while LANL2DZ basis set [37-39]for Ti atom. Dye $@$ $\\mathrm{Ti}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{20}\\mathrm{H}_{22}$ systems were also optimized using same approach. CAM-B3LYP functional and 6- $31{+}\\mathrm{G}^{\\ast}$ basis set for non-metal atoms while LANL2DZ basis set for Ti atom were used to calculate the UV/vis spectra of Dye $\\mathcal{Q}\\mathrm{Ti}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{20}\\mathrm{H}_{22}$ systems.  \n\n# 3. Results and discussion  \n\nIn this study, we presented the results of theoretical designing of efficient sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells. Structures of dyes heterocyclic azo are given in Figure 2.  DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed to study the dyes. Key parameters: (i) open-circuit photovoltage (Voc); (ii) light harvesting efficiency (LHE); (iii) injection driving force $(\\Delta G^{i n j e c t})$ were calculated.  \n\n# 3.1. Energy level alignment  \n\nSuitable energy levels and locations of the HOMOs and LUMOsof the dye sensitizer are required to match the iodine/iodide redox potential and the conduction band edge level of the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ semiconductor [40].The energy level diagram of the HOMOs andLUMOs of the dyes, Ecb of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and redox potential energyof the electrolyte are presented in Figure 3.For all the dyes considered here, the simulated LUMOs lie above the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ conduction band edge (4.00 eV in vacuum)[41], providing the thermodynamic driving force for favorable electron injection from the excited state dye to the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ conduction band edge. Meanwhile the HOMOs of all dyes lie below the iodide redox potential ( $4.80{\\mathrm{~eV}}$ in vacuum)[42],leading to a fast dye regeneration and avoiding thegeminate charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photo-injected electrons in the nanocrystalline titania film.  \n\n# 3.2. UV-Vis spectra of dyes  \n\nTo gain insight into the excited states responsible for intense absorption spectra of sensitizers, TD-DFT calculations were performed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G\\* level. In the TD-DFT calculations of absorptionspectra, the 20 lowest singlet-singlet transitions were taken into account.  \n\nThe computed maximum absorption wavelengths $(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}})$ , absorption energy, oscillator strengths $(f)$ and nature of the transitions are summarized in Table 2.All the dyes showed absorption in visible region (502-521 nm). Absorbance in visible region is required for high efficiency. Oscillator strengths were also high (0.473-0.961). Another factor related to efficiency of DSSC is the performanceof the dyes to response the incident light. Values of light harvesting efficiency (LHE)have to be as high as possible to maximize the photocurrent response. The LHE can be expressed as[43]:  \n\n$$\nL H E=1-10^{-f}\\Rightarrow(1)\n$$  \n\nWhere $f$ is the oscillator strength.Values of LHE are given in Table 2. LHE values were high(0.663-0.891).  \n\n# 3.3 Adsorption of dyes on $\\mathbf{TiO}_{2}$ surface  \n\nA correct prediction of the adsorption geometry of the dye is an essential prerequisite for the theoretical description of the interface electronic structure and the charge transfer characteristics. The effect of adsorption on the electronic structure, especially the positions of the dye’s LUMO and the conduction band (CB) of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , are of the greatest relevance for the physics of DSSC devices, because the energies of these levels affect injection rates (and therefore the short-circuit current $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC,}}$ ) and the open-circuit voltage $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$ , and thus the efficiency of the solar cell. Most of the theoretical studies of dyes’ adsorption have considered adsorption on TiO2 surfaces, especially the most stable anatase (101) and rutile (110) surface.  \n\nNature of excited states of semiconductor/dye interface controls the electron injection rate from dye to semiconductor. Hence, the computational modeling of semiconductor/dye interface is considered to be a very useful tool to optimized DSSCs. In this regard, simulations of the electronic and optical properties of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ nanoparticles and the dye excited states were performed.  \n\n# 3.3.1 Adopted model for $\\mathbf{TiO}_{2}$ film  \n\nSemiconductor is one of the main components in the DSSCs and nano structured $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ has frequently been used in the most efficient DSSC systems. $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ has three major crystalline structures; rutile, anatase and brookite. However, the electrodes in photovoltaic cells are often based on anatase and the (101) surface of anatase is thermodynamically most stable surface[3, 44]. $\\mathrm{Ti}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{20}\\mathrm{H}_{22}$ (101) model from crystal structures is adopted as surface of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ film in the current work.  \n\nThe $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ surfaces were generated from the optimized bulk geometry exposing the most thermodynamically stable (101) surface of anatase. Our $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ model is not cluster model, which is cut out from relaxed surface slab. These Ti atoms can be divided into two types: One is fivecoordinated and another is six-coordinated. The five-coordinated Ti atoms are located at anatase (101) surface, which used for adsorption site. In addition, the six-coordinated Ti atoms cut out from the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ crystal bulk. And hydrogen saturators were used on oxygen atoms, and this method not only maintains bond-orientation in crystal, but also avoids the chaos of charge and multiplicity in the whole system. This model is small enough that the relativelylarge basis set (6-  \n\n$31{+}\\mathrm{G^{\\ast}})$ can be adopted in calculation. From several adsorption configurations, bidentate chelating adsorption mode is used which is energetically more favorable [3].  \n\n# 3.3.2 Electronic and Optical Properties of the Dye $\\mathbf{@TiO}_{2}$ System  \n\nIt is found that electronic and optical properties of dyes showed significant changes when absorbed to $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , might be due to interaction between the dyes and the semiconductor. Therefore, we have also simulated the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the dyes after binding to $\\mathrm{Ti}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{20}\\mathrm{H}_{22}$ cluster at the same level of theory for the free dyes except that the LANL2DZ basis set was used for Ti atom. The results from these investigations are listed in Table 3. Average calculated distances between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ surface (O–Ti bond) was $2.0{-}2.1\\mathring\\mathrm{A}$ .This shorter distance indicates probably stronger electronic coupling between dyes and semiconductor.We found that after binding to $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , dyes showed red-shift in the maximum absorption wavelengths. Red-shift of absorption spectra of dye after binding $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ can be explain on the basis of interactions between electron acceptor group of dye (–COOH) and the 3d orbitals of the Ti atom, resulting  an overall decrease in the LUMO energies as compare with the isolated dyes. Oscillating strength $(f)$ was improved due to the interaction between the dyes and the semiconductor comparing with the free dyes.  In addition, after binding to the semiconductor, the LHE of the dyes showed an increase. HOMOs and LUMOs of dyes $\\textstyle{\\mathcal{@}}\\operatorname{TiO}_{2}$ are given in Figure 4.  \n\n# 3.4. Performance of DSSCs based on dyes  \n\nThe  overall  efficiency   of  the  DSSC  can  be  calculated  from the  integral  of  short-circuit photocurrent  density  (JSC),  open  circuit  potential $(\\mathrm{V_{OC}})$ ,  the  fill  factor  (ff)  and  the intensity  of  light  (IS), expressed  by  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{V_{o c}J_{s c}K F}{I_{s}}{\\times}100\\%\\Rightarrow(2)\n$$  \n\n# 3.4.1 Factors influencing Jsc  \n\nThe $\\mathrm{J_{sc}}$ in DSSCs is determined by the following equation:  \n\n$$\nJ_{_{S C}}=\\int_{\\lambda}{\\cal L}H E(\\lambda)\\Phi_{_{i n j e c t.}}\\eta_{_{c o l l e c t.}}d\\lambda\\Rightarrow(3)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{LHE}(\\lambda)$ is the light harvesting efficiencyat a given wavelength, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{inject.}}$ is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect. is the charge collection efficiency. For the same DSSCs with onlydifferent dyes, just as for the organic dyes under study, it is reasonable to assume that the ηcollect. is a constant. As a result, the enhancement of $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ should focus on improving the LHE and Фinject.  \n\nAs discussed above, if the charge collection efficiency $\\left(\\eta_{\\mathrm{collect.}}\\right)$ could be considered as a constant for the same cell architecture, LHE and $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{inject.}}$ . are the two main factors influencing JSC. According to eqn (3), in order to obtain a high $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ , the efficientorganic dyes used in DSSCs should have a large LHE.The LHE of dyes was high.  \n\nAnother way to enhance $\\mathrm{J}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ is to improve $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{inject}}$ . which is related to the driving force $(\\Delta G^{i n j e c t})$ of the electron injection from the photoinduced excited states of organic dyes to the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ surface. In general, larger $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ leads to larger $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{inject.}}$ .  \n\nComputation of electron injection rate is very useful to study photovoltaic data. Following equation is used to calculate free energy change (in eV) for the electron injection:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}=E_{O X}^{d y e^{*}}-E_{C B}^{T i O_{2}}\\Rightarrow(4)\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{O X}^{d y e^{*}}$ is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state, $E_{C B}^{T i O_{2}}$ is the reduction potential of the conduction band of theTiO2 ( $E_{C B}^{T i O_{2}}=4.0\\mathrm{eV)}$ . $E_{O X}^{d y e^{*}}$ can be estimated by[45]:  \n\n$$\nE_{o X}^{d y e^{*}}=E_{o X}^{d y e}-E_{00}\\Rightarrow(5)\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{O X}^{d y e}$ is the oxidation potential energy of the dye in the ground state, while $\\mathrm{E_{00}}$ is an electronic vertical transition energy corresponding to the $\\lambda_{\\operatorname*{max}}.E_{O X}^{d y e}$ can be estimated as  negative EHOMO[46].By using this scheme, we calculated $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ , as well as $E_{O X}^{d y e}$ and $E_{O X}^{d y e^{*}}$ for  dyes and the results are listed in Table 4. We found that all the calculated $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ were negative, which means that the dye excited state lies above the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ conduction band edge, favoring the injection of the electron from the excited state dye to the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ conduction band edge. Dyes would show higher JSC due superior LHE and $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ $(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{inject.}})$ . Moreover, the calculated $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ of all the four studied dyes 1-4 have been observed-0.103, -0.191, -0.237 and -0.136 revealing that dye 3 might have superior light to power conversion efficiency than other counterparts.  \n\n# 3.4.2.Open-circuit photovoltage $(\\mathbf{V_{OC}})$  \n\nThe $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$ is obtained only by experiment, the relationship among these quantities andthe electronic structure of dye is still unknown.The analyticalrelationship between VOC and ELUMO may exist. According to the sensitized mechanism (electron injected from the excited dyes to the semiconductor conduction band) and single electron and single state approximation, there is an energy relationship [47]:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{~\\bf~e~}V_{o c}=E_{L U M o}-E_{c B}\\Rightarrow(6)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{E_{CB}}$ is the energy of the semiconductor’s conduction band edge. It  is  known  that  the higher  the ELUMO,  the  larger  the $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$ . High values of LHE, $\\Delta G^{i n j e c t}$ and $\\mathrm{eV_{OC}}$ indicate that all dyes would show high efficiency in dye sensitized solar cell.  \n\n# 4. Conclusions  \n\nOpen-circuit photovoltage (VOC), factors influencing the short-circuit current density $(\\mathrm{{J}_{{S C}}})$ including light harvesting efficiency and electron injection efficiency, have been discussed comprehensively. We hope this work will be helpful for thedesign of organic dyes with target properties to improve theperformance of dye sensitized solar cells.All the dyes showed absorbance in visible region $\\mathrm{\\nabla}{\\cdot}502{\\cdot}521\\mathrm{nm})$ ) with high oscillator strength $(f)$ (0.573-0.991) and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) (0.663-0.891). After binding to titanium oxide, all dye showed slightly red-shifted absorption $\\left(521-527\\mathrm{nm}\\right)$ with improved oscillator strength $(f)$ (0.573-0.991) and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) (0.733-0.898). There is high probability that these dyes will show larger JSC due to high driving force for electron injection. These dyes also showed larger $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$ (1.037-1.128 eV). The superior electron injection of dye 3 revealed that that this heterocyclic azo dye might show better light to power conversion efficiency in DSSCs.  \n\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \n\nAuthors would like to acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Higher Education, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for this research through a Grant (PCSED-006-14) under the Promising Centre for Sensors and Electronic Devices (PCSED) at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  \n\n# 5.
