Two have been operated in cascade, demonstrating logic gain. Bistable operation is not critically dependent on supply voltages, trigger characteristics or temperature. With minor modification of this design,it should be possible to obtain circuits operating at different voltage and current levels, and to increase the switching speed. ",
