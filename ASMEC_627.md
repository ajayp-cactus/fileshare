Restaging Abdominopelvic Computed Tomography Before Surgery After Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) before surgery is a standard treatment for locally advanced cancer in the mid or low rec- tum. Long-course CRT delays surgery for several months, which may introduce a possibility, albeit small, for the tumor to make systemic progression or for occult metastasis to grow and manifest. Currently, there is no consensus regarding whether restaging abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) is necessary before surgery after long- course CRT. Several studies have investigated this issue -$^{1,}$5; however, results were conflicting. Most of the studies were small, 1,2,4,5 None of them compared the oncologic outcomes between patients who received and those who did not

receive (as controls) the restaging CT$^{1,}$5 This study investig- gated restaging abdominopelvic CT performed before sur- ger after CRT in patients with locally advanced rectal can- cer regarding its diagnostic yield and effect on postsurgical recurrence-free survival (RFS).

Methods The institutional review board of Asan Medical Cen- ter approved this observational study and a waiver of written informed consent was included. Between 2011 and 2015, 449 eligible patients (294 [65%] men with a mean [SD] age of 62.5 [11.6] years and 155 [35%] women with a mean [SD] age of 61.8 [11.9] years) were included (Figure). Patients underwent long- course preoperative CRT over 5 to 6 weeks including either fluo- rouracil plus leucovorin or capecitabine (details are available elsewhere).$^{6}$ All patients were reexamined with high- resolution rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approxi- mately 4 to 6 weeks after completing CRT, and 231 also under- went restaging contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT 77 to

Results | The diagnostic yield of restaging abdominopelvic CT was 2.2% (5 of 231 patients; 95% CI, 0.8%-5.1%), all as hepatic metastases treated with curative resection. Restaging abdominopelvic CT yielded false-positive findings in 3 patients (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.3%-3.9%), causing unnecessary hepatic resection, radiofrequency ablation, and follow-up liver MRI. When patients who had pre-CRT extramural venous invasion, MR tumor regression grade 4 to 5, or worsening of carcinomyrobic onic antigen after CRT were considered, the yield was 5.1% (4 of 78; 95% CI, 1.6%-12.2%). The RFS was not significantly different between the restaging CT (followed postoperatively for 1-74 months) and no-restaging CT (followed postoperatively for 1-70 months; reference) groups: hazard ratios of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.78-1.84) for multivariable-adjusted regression, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.74-1.76) for PS-based inverse probability weighting, and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.68-1.77) for PS matching.

Discussion | Despite benefits in a small fraction of patients, performing restaging abdominopelvic CT routinely before surgery after CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer is not beneficial if a thorough initial staging evaluation excluded metastasis. It had low diagnostic yield, comparable risk of orphan, and no apparent gains in postsurgical RFS (possibly harmful or, at most, modest beneficial effect). Further studies are needed to identify patients at high risk of developing metastasis during CRT for whom restaging abdominopelvic CT could be indicated. Nonrandomized observational design was a study limitation.
