However, the ORR active site (or sites) is unclear, which retards further developments of high-performance catalysts. Here, we characterized the ORR active site by using newly designed graphite (highly oriented pyrolitic graphite) model catalysts with well-defined $\\pi$ conjugation and well-controlled doping of N species. The ORR active site is created by pyridinic N. Carbon dioxide adsorption experiments indicated that pyridinic N also creates Lewis basic sites. The specific activities per pyridinic N in the HOPG model catalysts are comparable with those of N-doped graphene powder catalysts. Thus, the ORR active sites in N-doped carbon materials are carbon atoms with Lewis basicity next to pyridinic N. ",

S4 for N 1s and fig. S5 for survey and C 1s spectra). The ORR activities differed because of the different nitrogen-doping conditions (Fig. 2A). The current densities at a specific potential [potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] for each ORR were extracted and plotted versus the corresponding concentrations of pyridinic N and graphitic N. Figure 2B illustrates the linear relationship between the current densities and concentration of pyridinic N at each investigated potential, independent of the preparation method, indicating that the ORR activity is determined solely by the pyridinic N concentration. This linear dependence also suggests that the inhomogeneities in the graphitization and size of the $\\pi$ -conjugation system in the samples were overcome successfully in the HOPG model catalysts by applying the same annealing temperature of 973 K. In contrast, there is no correlation between the current density and the concentration of graphitic N (fig. S6).

The copper centers are topologically independent of the weaving within the COF structure and serve as templates for bringing the threads into a woven pattern rather than the more commonly observed parallel arrangement. The copper(I) ions can be reversibly removed and added without loss of the COF structure, for which a tenfold increase in elasticity accompanies its demetalation. The threads in COF-505 have many degrees of freedom for enormous deviations to take place between them, throughout the material, without undoing the weaving of the overall structure. ",

Although terms such as interweaving (3), polycatenated (2), and interpenetrating (4–6) have been used to describe interlocking of 2D and 3D extended objects (Fig. 1, C and D), most commonly found in MOFs, we reserve the term “weaving” to describe exclusively the interlacing of 1D units to make 2D and 3D structures (Fig. 1, A and B). Weaving differs from the commonly observed interpenetrating and polycatenated frameworks because the latter are topologically interlocking ",
