        "text": "Aging characteristics of insulation continued to be a problem in 1955.  Methods for determining thermal aging were:'.:. ';icularly evaluated. A new method was described by Whitman and Scheideler (5) for determining the effect of thermal aging on the shearing modulus of flexible sheet insulation by nondestructive tests using a torsion pendulum technique. The data obtained are valuable for determining the effects of time and temperature on an important mechanical property of flexible sheet materia13, Since tests may be made as a function of aging on a given sample, the technique is very useful in establishing deterioration rates of the shearing modulus for a given insulation.  Significant factors involved in thermal tests of flexible sheet insulation are given by Dakin, Philofsky, and Divens (6) .  In the life-test of varnished glass cloth, they find that many arbitrary decisions have to be made about such factors as aging, crack­ ::  ,  humidity, and electrode size.  The test evaluated can only measure the relative life of any combination of insulation.  Irreversible thermal behavior of solid organic insulating materials is discussed by Reimer (7) in a German publication.  He studied the variation of mechanical strength, power factor, breakdown strength, and loss in weight of acetate, triester, polyamide and polyvinyl chloride foils, cellulose paper, varnishes and resins after aging at various temperatures.  He concludes that satisfactory thermal classification of a material must be based on a knowledge of several of these properties.  Maxwell (8) indicated that the mechanical engineering of dielectric components for electronic applications cannot be attacked by the same methods used for more conventional materials.  The effects of time and temperature must be considered in reference to the types of loading to be expected and the ambient temperature.  Proper selection and design can only be accomplished after consideration of three-dimensional plots of the engineering properties versus both time and temperature.  A review of problems and recent developments regarding temperature classification of insulation was presented by Sidway (9).  He discusses AIEE Standard No. 1 (revised February, 1954), International Insulation Standards (International Electro-Technical Publication No. $34$ ), and test codes which will supplement these.  Thurn (10) reported that.dielectric constants, sound-transmitting properties, and ultrasonic damping power are functions of temperature. Diagrams and graphs are given.  Chapman and co-workers (11, 12) show the effects of temperature and humidity on permittivity, loss angle, electric strength, flashover voltage, and surface and volume resistivities of molded mica-filled phenoliCS, glass, silicone laminate, polyethylene, and poly­ tetrafluorethylene (Teflon).  Moisture affects electrical properties at low frequency and direct current more than at radio-frequency. ",

This new insulating enamel has been tested for over a year in motors, and in transformers and coils of high-temperature re:layso  The enamel has been successfully applied to all copper wire from gauge 40 to gauge 10.  Resistance to Freon 12 and 2·2 is ss.id to be three times better than conventional wire coatings.  Westinghouse claims that raising the tem,perature limit to $325^{\\circ}\\mathtt{F}$ will permit a reduction in the size of present motors.  The insulation thickness would be reduced by 50 per cent, making a 7-l/2-hp motor no larger than the 5-hp motor of today. ",

He discussed recent developments in conductor coatings, especially Dacron fiber wound parallel and side by side with glass and laid down as a double or single serving upon electrical conductors.  This material, after heat treating, provides a durable chamical resistant prime insulation which has rugged thermal endurance.  Conductor coating compounds belonging to the epoxy family are now in production.  Teflon is a valuable produce combining chemical stability at high temperatures with almost complete chemical inertness, but the difficulty of bonding Teflon to other materials greatly limits its usefulness.  Other items discussed were:  today's impreg­ nants and understanding silicones.  Future developments included triallyl cyanurate as a crosslinking material and radiation-sensitive materials. ",
